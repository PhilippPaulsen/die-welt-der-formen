# The World of Forms

## Overview
**The World of Forms** is a design research project (2023–2025) exploring the interplay of rule-based, generative, and intuitive approaches to design. By focusing on form-generation algorithms developed by figures like Sébastien Truchet, Dominique Douat, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Hans Hinterreiter, this project investigates how structured systems can yield dynamic artistic expressions.

## Objectives
The research bridges traditional design principles with contemporary generative models, uncovering new possibilities at the intersection of science and art. Key areas of focus include:
- Experimenting with materials like wood alongside 3D animation, augmented reality (AR), and coding.
- Visual-to-music mapping and AI-driven design.
- Integrating historical statistical and morphological theories into modern design systems.

## Features
This project includes:
- Historical analyses of form-generation algorithms.
- Experimentation with generative design systems across physical and digital media.
- Interactive visual and auditory outputs using advanced technologies.
