  By *space*, we mean the way in which we experience the external world. If we disregard all specific contents that come to our consciousness in the form of colors, sounds, temperatures, pressure sensations, etc., and instead ask what all parts of the external world have in common, their *spatial nature* remains. Accordingly, every object has its own share of the total space in which we perceive the external world; we call this share its *shape* [Gestalt] or form, whereby such a form or shape may exhibit all degrees of determinacy or indeterminacy.`
  )}
  
  function _8(md){return(
  md`#### The Three Types of Space  
  Space is either *corporeal*, *planar*, or finitely *linear*. In the first case, it is *three-dimensional*, in the second *two*-dimensional, and in the last *one*-dimensional. If we wish to consider its manifestations, as is necessary when working on a new domain, in the sense of increasing complexity, we must begin with the simplest case, the linear *space*, and then proceed to examine the two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces.  
  In geometry, the aforementioned determinations are carried out with the utmost rigor. Planes have no thickness, lines no width, and points no extension. The practical-aesthetic spatial theory that concerns us here does not allow for such extensive abstractions. Our lines will always have a distinct width, our planes a certain thickness or height, without letting these considerations disturb us. It is only required that the one-dimensionality in lines and the two-dimensionality in planes predominate so strongly that the existing deviations do not carry weight, i.e., do not significantly alter the phenomena under investigation.`
  )}
  
  function _9(md){return(
  md`#### The Uniformity of Space
  When we move a rigid body through space, we
  generally perceive it as different. However, through a not entirely
  simple process of abstraction, we come to the understanding that these
  differences are merely subjective-perspectival and arise from the
  changed spatial relationship between the body and the observer's eye,
  not from the body itself. Instead, we attribute to it everywhere the
  same shape or spatial nature.  
  If we successively place the body in adjacent positions, *identical*
  spatial parts arise according to this premise. This is the foundation of
  all division and therefore all *measurement* of space. We find that
  this procedure can be carried out consistently throughout space and
  therefore attribute to space uniformity (*homogeneity*). `

  md`#### Geometric and Illustrative Lines and Points
  A geometric line, which
  by definition has no width, is invisible, as visibility requires a width
  of approximately 0.0001 of the visual angle (i.e., 1 mm at a distance of
  10 m). Thus, the figures of finite width, to which our considerations
  apply, are geometrically not lines, but planes, specifically elongated
  rectangles.  
  Similarly, geometric points, the only possible distinctions on a
  geometric line, are invisible and must be replaced by small planes to be
  visible. `

  md`#### The Fundamental Principle of Spatial Harmony
  If a point is represented by an *arbitrarily* shaped small surface, as shown in Fig.
  1, we are dissatisfied. We ask the designer why this particular random
  form was chosen and are only satisfied if an adequate explanation is
  provided. However, if the point is represented by a circular area, a
  square, or a hexagon, as in Fig. 2, we agree and raise no further
  questions. This assumes that the form is not tilted, as in Fig. 3; in
  such a case, we would inquire about a justification for this
  arbitrariness, whereas with an upright position, whether horizontal or
  diagonal, as in Fig. 4, we are satisfied.  `

  md`Similarly, we agree if a line or stripe is evenly spaced, as shown in
  Fig. 5. On the other hand, if the division is arbitrary, executed with

  distinctly present positive aesthetic value of uniform division, instead
  possessing a negative one; it appears unattractive.

  md`However, not every unequal division is unattractive. If the spacings of
  the divisions are assigned as, for example, those on the logarithmic
  slide rule for equally spaced numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., Fig. 7, a
  positive aesthetic value arises. These spacings have the property that
  any two successive ones decrease in the same ratio (according to a
  geometric or logarithmic series). Upon closer examination, this series
  even possesses an aesthetic advantage over the evenly spaced one. It
  appears "more interesting" because it is much less frequently
  encountered than the latter.  
  From these and countless other observations, we derive (in a very broad
  generalization) a law, which states:  
  
  *All lawful forms are harmonious.*  
  
  By harmonious, we mean beautiful or pleasant in the broadest sense. This
  statement, the *Fundamental Principle of Spatial Harmony*, has the
  nature of a postulate, i.e., a probable assumption that serves as a
  primary order of facts and whose validity must always be tested through
  concordance with experience. It is identical to the Fundamental
  Principle of Color Harmony, and it holds a general significance for all
  art. We can also express it in the form of an equation:  
  
  *Lawfulness = Harmony.*  
  
  Goethe conducted his entire artistic life's work in the light of this
  insight and also expressed it explicitly in the closing words of his art
  sonnet:  
  
  *And only law can give us freedom.*  
  
  We therefore call this general law of art, of which color and spatial
  harmony are merely specific applications, the *Goethean Law*.  `

  md`#### Types of Lines
  The simplest structure that exists here is the
  uninterrupted, uniformly strong line, as drawn with the ruling pen,
  pencil, or pen. It can be *straight*, *curved*, or composed of
  several straight, several curved, or both straight and curved lines. The
  straight line is the most important because it is the simplest or most
  lawful case; a completely arbitrary stroke represents the opposite
  extreme of complete freedom.  
  The main application of the line is, according to its origin, the
  delimitation of surfaces. If these are differentiated by color,
  position, etc., the boundary lines arise naturally. However, art tends
  to emphasize such natural phenomena with special forms; for example, two
  different surfaces are usually not simply joined but rather highlighted
  by a special line (in the graphic sense). Additionally, the line serves
  as a tool to *divide* a surface that is not yet differentiated, which
  is a very important task.  `
  )}
  
  function _18(md){return(
  md`#### Thickness of Lines  
  The first requirement that must be met by a line is its *clarity*. It
  was previously noted that the visibility of a line ceases when its width
  falls below 1/10,000 of the viewing distance. In art, such extreme
  values (except for special purposes) are widely avoided; a practical
  lower limit can be set at approximately ten times that value, 1/1,000.
  For an object with a surface width of 50 cm at its narrowest, the line
  should not be narrower than 1/2 mm for our purposes.  `
  )}
  
  function _19(md){return(
  md`#### Edge or Contour
  As a marker of a boundary, the line must follow it.
  In the simplest case, it lies directly on the boundary. However, there
  are numerous cases where it accompanies the boundary at a certain
  distance. *This distance must be equal everywhere*, measured
  perpendicular to the boundary line. It must, in any case, be greater
  than the minimum line width and is usually significantly larger.  
  For example, if a rectangle is provided with such a boundary line, the
  distance is not made different along the sides in proportion to the side
  lengths, Fig. 8, so that the inner rectangle would geometrically
  resemble the outer one. In such a case, the accompanying line would not
  be perceived as an *edge*. Instead, the distance is taken to be equal
  everywhere, Fig. 9, which makes the inner rectangle relatively slimmer
  than the outer one.  `

  function _21(md){return(
  md`#### Diversity
  When going beyond the immediate purpose of marking, one can multiply the simple, uniform line sequence for decorative purposes. This can be done in the following ways:
  
  1.  The line is (entirely or approximately) uniform in thickness and continuous;
  
  2.  the line is discontinuous, being broken into a series of dots and dashes;
  
  3.  the line varies in thickness along its course¹;
  
  4.  the line is not straight but dynamic, i.e., somehow curved or broken.  
      Properties 2, 3, and 4 can simultaneously occur in the same line. 
      Since each of these properties offers two possibilities (present or
      not present), there are a total of eight groups encompassing a very
      large number of individual cases.
        
      1) H. Prof. Krais brought this diversity to my attention.  `
  )}
  
  function _22(md){return(
  md`#### Individual Examination  
  We turn to the separate consideration of the cases just outlined. It
  should be noted that it will not later be possible to examine all
  the numerous possibilities arising in the less simple figures
  (braids, bands, surfaces) with the same level of detail; thus, the
  following considerations not only serve to elucidate the current
  task but also as an example of how the reader might later fill in
  the framework provided by the mathematical treatment of the cases.
  It should also be noted that the diversities identified here will
  apply universally to later cases. For we are always dealing either
  directly with lines or with the mutual boundaries of surfaces, which
  are also lines. However, in the latter case, one will approach the
  design of the line in the sense described here with greater restraint.  `
  )}
  
  function _23(md){return(
  md`#### Discontinuous Lines
  The resolution of a simple line can occur
      into *dots* and *dashes*. Accordingly, there are discontinuous
      lines consisting solely of dots, solely of dashes, and finally of
      dots alongside dashes.  
      The dots are either round or square. The second form arises
      naturally when the line is created with a pen through regular
      interruptions of the stroke. Round dots are more natural and appear
      where pen creation is not feasible, for example, in letterpress
      printing. The spacing, simplest when equal to the dot width, can
      also be adjusted arbitrarily, Fig. 10 a.  
      The dashes can vary in length. However, they must not be so short
      that they are confused with dots, nor so long that the interruptions
      appear arbitrary. A length five to ten times the thickness seems
      appropriate. The spacing must maintain a visible proportion to the
      dash length, approximately 1:5, Fig. 10 b.  
      It would be worthwhile to examine these proportions more closely to
      determine where the most pleasing effects occur.  
      When combining dots and dashes, the alternation *p s p s p s ...* or
      abbreviated as *p s* is the simplest case, Fig. 10 c. `

  md`More complex
      cases, such as *p p s, p p s s, p p p s*, etc., are less common and
      eventually become confusing.  
      For all cases considered, the law holds that the sizes and spacings
      of the segments remain consistent throughout the entire line
      sequence. An unlawful deviation would appear disorderly and
      arbitrary, thus unattractive. However, the simple law of equality is
      not the only possibility. One can also group multiple dots (dashes)
      into clusters that are separated by larger but still equal intervals
      among themselves. This creates a more intricate equality, but still
      maintains lawfulness. `
  )}
  
  function _26(md){return(
  md`#### Unequal Thickness
  The design of the writing pen with two
      springy tips, which open depending on the pressure applied,
      naturally produces this effect, which is of the most general use in
      writing. It is noteworthy that the previously (in English script)
      popular *continuous* transitions from one thickness to another are
      increasingly regarded as less beautiful and are being replaced by
      clear distinctions between thick and thin strokes, resulting in a
      stronger and more \\"characterful\\" script.  
      This type is used less frequently for line decoration; it is most
      often employed where a connection to handwritten work is to be
      emphasized. The diversity is similar to that of the previous case,
      except that the interruptions of the line are replaced by its
      variations in thickness.`
  )}
  
  function _27(md){return(
  md`#### Dynamic Lines
  As book ornaments, lines can be found that show
      small irregularities, as if drawn freehand. They are an expression
      of a skewed sentimentality that ascribes a \\"higher artistic value\\"
      to craftsmanship and seeks to create its semblance even where it is
      evidently excluded by the method of production.  
      Significantly different from these are the *lawful* dynamics. As a
      very general principle, *repetition* emerges, as already discussed
      in the context of interrupted lines. Through lawful repetition, one
      can remove arbitrariness from any free stroke and bestow upon it the
      simple aesthetic value inherent in visual lawfulness.  `
  )}
  
  function _28(md){return(
  md`#### Shifting.
  Repetition occurs along the direction of the entire
      line, as the chosen form is repeated at a fixed, consistent
      interval, effectively "shifted." This process is thus referred to
      as *shifting*.  
      Shifting involves mapping each point in the original form to a
      corresponding point in the second position, equidistant from the
      original. All these connecting lines, of identical length, are also
      *parallel*¹.  
      This results in an exact repetition of the original form at a
      defined distance from it.  
      Shifting is one of the three fundamental operations through which a
      simple form element can give rise to a lawfully composed form. For
      this reason, it will frequently be employed in the discussions that
      follow.  
      Shifting can be repeated indefinitely, producing lines of any
      desired length.`

  The line repeated through shifting is
      initially assumed to be entirely arbitrary. In particular, we do not
      assume that the beginning and end of the repetitions of the original
      form created by shifting coincide. The only regularity present in
      the resulting overall form, which we shall call a *sequence*, is
      limited to the bare repetition. Fig. 11 shows a sequence. `

  md`The size of the shift for any form to create waves is called the
      *wavelength*. Since, according to the description of shifting, all
      distances between corresponding points are equal, the same
      wavelength is found regardless of the point from which it is
      measured to the corresponding point of repetition. The *wave* can
      therefore be viewed and drawn from any arbitrary point. Often, the
      original form is such that it contains particularly distinctive
      points, which are well-suited for measurement.  
      Every wave has a specific *wave height*. Through the highest and
      lowest points of the wave, one draws a straight line in the
      direction of the wave; the distance between these lines is the wave
      height. This determines the width of the strip covered by the
      wave.  `
  )}
  
  function _35(md){return(
  md`#### Continuity
  The lawful coherence within a line is referred to as
      its *continuity*. This relates to three distinct properties:
      continuity of *course*, *direction*, and *curvature*.  
      The first is that the line experiences no *interruption*. The
      presence or absence of this property is the basis for the
      distinction we just made between sequences and waves. The
      interruption shall be called a *jump*.  
      When comparing the lines in Fig. 13a and b, one senses that 13a is

      This *circle of curvature* has a radius *r*, which in the form
      ¹⁄*r* represents the measure of the curvature at that point.

  We thus have the following series of lines,

  1.  Straight lines;
  
  2.  Circles;
  
  3.  Continuous lines;
  
  4.  Lines with shocks;
  
  5.  Lines with kinks;
  
  6.  Lines with jumps.
    
  As segments in cases 3 to 6, both curves and straight lines can occur. Particularly after case 5, lines frequently consist solely of interconnected straight segments. Among the three types of discontinuities, the *shock* (No. 4) is not yet consciously utilized. On average, the eye is not yet trained to immediately recognize existing shocks. A lawful application of shocks is not yet perceived as a playful engagement with variety and, therefore, has no aesthetic value.  
  This does not preclude the possibility that lawful shocks may be
      considered beautiful in the future. Our sense of form is, due to a
      lack of methodical, i.e., scientific cultivation, almost as
      underdeveloped as our sense of color. This stems from the fact that
      the so-called science of art has remained on the primitive level of
      historical compilation, without its practitioners considering even
      attempting the higher level of methodical or mathematical treatment
      of the entire world of forms, let alone entering it. Yet all art
      education calls—indeed, cries out—for such guidance. Even now,
      with this work having broken ground for such endeavors, many years
      will pass before the representatives of this field dare to embark on
      this new path. Most lack not only the knowledge of mathematics and
      geometry, which are prerequisites for cultivating form harmony, but
      also the scientific mindset indispensable for understanding the
      tasks presented here. It is thus understandable that they oppose any
      advance in this direction, which diverges significantly from the
      barren historicism they pursue and demands rigorous intellectual

  According to the rules of analytic
      geometry, sequences and waves can first be related to an abscissa
      axis that runs approximately below the forms in its direction.
      Perpendicular to it, we construct as many ordinates as desired,
      whose peaks lie on the line. The three continuity requirements are
      then expressed as follows:  
      Continuous progression without a jump requires that the ordinates
      *y* along the abscissa axis *x* remain constant or change
      continuously.  
      Continuous progression without a kink requires that the first
      derivatives *dy/dx* are everywhere constant or continuous.  
      Continuous progression without a shock requires that the second
      derivatives *d²y/dx²* are everywhere constant or continuous. Higher
      derivatives may be continuous or discontinuous without these
      differences being perceived.  `

  Based on the investigation just conducted, we can

      excluded by definition. However, the lines from which the waves are
      formed through shifting may contain *kinks* and *shocks*, whose
      elimination leads to an increasing degree of lawfulness.  
      We will therefore initially use only fully continuous lines as the
      most lawful and therefore most beautiful for waves. This requires
      that not only does the original form contain no kinks or shocks, but
      also that neither kinks nor shocks occur at the points of
      repetition. If such features are present in the original form, they
      may also be permitted at the joints, provided they are justified by
      some other form of lawfulness to achieve aesthetic value.  `

  To ensure the alignment (rapport) when designing waves, one proceeds
      by first specifying the direction in which the wave is to run
      overall. Along this direction, the length of the original form is
      marked, and one begins to draw it from its starting point, which is
      most conveniently assumed to lie on the direction line. After
      determining about a third of it, the drawing is immediately repeated
      on the right at the beginning of the second section. The original
      form can now be completed so that the curve transitions continuously
      into the already existing beginning of the repetition, thereby
      solving the task of alignment.`

  function _48(md){return(
  md`#### Sine Waves
  Until now, apart from continuity, we have made no
      assumptions about the shape of the wave line; its freedom is further
      restricted only by the requirements of equal recurrence and
      alignment.  
      This represents the *greatest* degree of freedom possible under
      the given conditions. To quickly grasp the full range of
      possibilities, we next consider the *smallest* degree of freedom
      or the strictest regularity. Such a type of wave line is known as
      the *sine wave*. These lines are created by dividing a circle into
      equal parts, drawing perpendiculars from the division points to the
      diameter, and arranging these at *equal* intervals on a straight
      line. The ends of these perpendiculars then lie on a sine wave,
      Fig. 18. The shape alternates between ascending and descending. The
      entire wave is repeated indefinitely through shifting.  
      Depending on whether the perpendiculars are spaced closely or
      widely, steep or flat sine waves are formed; depending on whether
      the circle is large or small, high or low wave trains are created.
      This provides two degrees of freedom, which can be adjusted based on
      the specific conditions of each application.  
      Despite its importance and beauty, the sine wave is rarely found in
      the works of decorative art, and it can be considered one of the
      achievements of this fundamental investigation to draw attention to
      the neglected fundamental form of all waves.`

      quantities on the abscissa can also be geometrically represented by
      sine waves. This line is entirely based on and contained within
      itself, and is therefore the archetype of the wave.  
      Moreover, all other waves, without exception, can be fully
      represented by the summation of sine waves, whose lengths are
      proportional to 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and so on, and whose starting
      points and amplitudes are determined by the wave line to be

  Since there is no simple technical means to draw sine waves
      mechanically, they are customarily replaced in art by two
      alternating semicircles joined together, which can be drawn with a
      compass, Fig. 19a. This substitute has spread widely due to its
      technical convenience, so much so that one almost never encounters a
      proper sine wave with its beautiful, continuous curvature transition
      in either applied or free art, while the Ersatz sine is very common.
      However, when the two forms are placed side by side, Fig. 19a and b,
      the aesthetic superiority of the true sine wave becomes immediately
      apparent. Its superiority lies in the fact that the false sine
      exhibits *shocks* at the junctions of the semicircles, as the
      centers of curvature jump by half a wavelength at each point, making
      them discontinuous.  `

  md`#### Reflection and Rotation
  Comparing the limited lawfulness of an
      arbitrary wave train with the perfect lawfulness of a sine wave
      reveals the constraints imposed on its freedom. An arbitrary wave
      train behaves differently when moving to the right versus the left;
      it is *directional*. The sine wave behaves the same in both
      directions; it is *stationary*. Furthermore, an arbitrary wave
      train is generally different when observed from above versus below;
      it is *unilateral*. The sine wave is identical above and below; it
      is *bilateral*.  
      These two principles of lawfulness can be individually applied to
      free forms. Starting with an arbitrary form *a b*, Fig. 20, one can
      repeat it mirror-symmetrically (see below) along its length. This
      creates a double form, *a b c*, symmetrical on both sides of a line,
      the reflection line or simply the mirror *b*: it is *symmetrical*
      or mirror-symmetric. Arranging such mirror-symmetric forms through
      shifting always results in a stationary wave train, and conversely,
      any stationary wave train can be decomposed into mirror-symmetric
      elements. Any existing unilaterality is not disturbed by this
      process.`

      it can be divided into mirror-symmetric segments and segments that
      transition into one another through rotation, it is neither
      directional nor unilateral. This is the case with the sine wave.  
      *Shifting*, *rotation*, and *reflection* are the three
      fundamental operations through which we create lawfully moving
      lines. However, it must be noted that both reflection and rotation
      only produce finite or closed forms. To create infinitely long
      waves, sequences, or other extended patterns, shifting is
      indispensable. We will later see that similar principles apply to
      all lawful forms in space. Therefore, the general theory of rotation
      and reflection is presented here, following the description of
      shifting above (p. 13).  `

  md`#### The Doctrine of Reflection
  By reflection, we generally mean a
      particular type of repetition, achieved as follows. Let any form *a
      b*, Fig. 22, be given, along with a plane *e e*, the mirror plane,
      which we assume, for clarity, to be outside the form but which can
      also lie within it. From each point of the form, a perpendicular is
      drawn through the plane, extended equally far on the opposite side
      as on the original side, and the new or mirror form *a\\' b\\'* is
      constructed from these points. This form retains all the properties
      of the original form, but in reversed or mirror-symmetric
      arrangement, like the right and left hands.  `

  function _60(md){return(
  md`If the given form lies in a plane and its mirror image is also to
      remain in the plane, then the mirror must be perpendicular to that
      plane, and only the part lying in the plane, the *reflection
      line*, comes into play. Therefore, we will initially deal only with
      reflection lines. If the mirror image of a free form is reflected
      again in the same mirror, a repetition occurs that completely
      matches the original form. Thus, any number of reflections yield
      only two distinguishable forms.  
      The original form and its mirror image are often combined into a
      composite form *b a a\\' b\\'*, Fig. 22. This is arranged
      symmetrically about the mirror plane, with identical but opposite
      arrangements to the left and right. This property is usually called
      *symmetry*, and the composite form is called *symmetric*. The
      mirror plane or line *e e* is called the symmetry plane or line.
      Instead, we use the terms mirror-symmetric and mirror plane or
      reflection line, as in *b a e a\\' b\\'*, Fig. 22.  
      Any arbitrary form, together with its mirror image, constitutes a
      "mirror pair." Reflecting a mirror pair transforms its right part
      into a left and its left part into a right. The composite form thus
      undergoes no change. Through the reflection, it is merely moved to
      another location and, in general, also rotated (see below). If the
      mirror plane is parallel to the mirror plane, only a pure shift
      occurs without rotation.`

  function _61(md){return(
  md`#### Application
  For the purposes of the current discussion, only a
      small portion of this general doctrine of reflection is
      required.Reflection in waves initially occurs only along a
      reflection line perpendicular to the main direction. This transforms
      any free curve into a mirror pair of double the length, Fig.
      20, p. 22. This structure can either remain as is or be multiplied
      to indefinite length through shifting.  
      The first case is used when the line is of a specific length. It can
      consist of any curve that is half the desired length and then
      mirrored. The form is chosen such that, if the ends are free, their
      tapering is emphasized. Often, the center is also given prominence,
      all while maintaining mirror symmetry.  
      In the second case, it should be noted that shifting can also be
      replaced by a series of reflections, as each mirror pair remains
      unchanged in this process.`

  A rotation occurs when a given form *a
      b*, Fig. 23, is related to a line, the axis *c*, and each of its
      points is moved along a circle whose plane is perpendicular to the
      axis by the same angle. In this process, the form itself remains
      unchanged; it is merely repeated in a new position.  
      A rotation increasingly resembles a shift as the axis is assumed to
      be farther from the form. At an infinitely large distance of the
      axis, the rotation transforms into a shift, as the parallel circular
      lines become parallel straight lines.`

      combine.  
      Fig. 24 illustrates, under *a*, *b*, *c*, a two-, three-, and
      four-fold turnling, all formed from the same basic shape.  
      In a two-fold rotation, if the rotation point lies at the endpoint
      of the line, the line continues into the rotated position without a
      jump or jolt, but generally with a shock. To avoid this as well, the

  For the present case, only rotation by half the full

      through the addition of the rotated version.  
      Although rotation is an even simpler process than reflection, as the
      form remains exactly preserved, the relationship of a given form to
      its rotated repetition is far less familiar to us than the
      reflective relationship. This is likely because our own bodies

      rotation. Consequently, we also lack common terminology to describe

      wavelength remains essentially constant as a damped oscillation
      tapers off. It cannot realistically become shorter. If it is reduced
      in the same proportion as the height, the entire wave shrinks

  md`#### Concept
  Until now, we have discussed only simple lines in their
      variety. We now turn to the more complex case where *several*
      lines combine into a unified linear entity. Such a structure will be
      called a *braid*.  
      However, true braid forms only emerge in the more intricate special
      cases of this section. Since these cannot be easily distinguished
      conceptually from the simpler cases of bare line groups, the term
      may be used for the entire class.  
      The subdivisions of this class are as follows:
  
  <!-- -->
  
  1.  Bare straight lines;
  
  2.  bare moving lines;
  
  3.  shifted waves or braids in the narrower sense.
    `
  )}
  
  function _88(md){return(
  md`#### Bare Straight Lines
  Bare lines of uniform thickness are
      initially used with *equal spacing*, similar to the five lines of
      musical notation. By maintaining a specific ratio between the width
      of the lines and the spaces between them, the overall impression can
      be adjusted to appear stronger or lighter, as desired.  
      Two, three, or at most four lines side by side can be perceived at a
      glance. When the number increases, they are more likely to be
      perceived as a group. This leads to situations where one
      intentionally approaches or exceeds the threshold of discernibility,
      so that the line group appears as a single broad, shadowy line.  
      In this context, there are three variables: the number, thickness,
      and spacing of the lines. Regarding the number, it has already been
      noted that five or more lines are used when the individual lines are
      not meant to be distinct. Otherwise, the double line (two lines) is
      the preferred solution, likely because it is the easiest to
      comprehend, whereas three lines are less common but possess a
      corresponding appeal.  
      The thickness of the lines is determined by the distance from which
      they are viewed; it should measure 1/1000 or more of the eye's
      distance. Additionally, it is advisable to align the line thickness
      with the thickness of any framed or bounded content if it contains
      lines.  
      Spacing can be chosen with the greatest freedom. A rule requiring
      equal proportions of black and white areas within the group would
      hardly make sense, as white lines appear much broader than black
      lines of the same width due to physiological reasons. The spacing
      for double lines will be determined by the requirement for clarity,
      whereas for a group of lines, it will depend on the intended depth
      of the shadow effect.`

      unattractive and is excluded from artistic treatment. We must

  md`In a group of lines with equal spacing, the sensation of the spacing
      also remains constant. If this sensation is to change in the
      simplest way---by equal amounts---then the spacing, as shown in Fig.
      36, must increase or decrease by equal ratios rather than by equal
      amounts. In other words, the spacing must be arranged in a geometric
      sequence rather than an arithmetic one. The geometric sequences used
      for this purpose differ in the ratio of their changes, which can
      take any value. If the ratio is greater than one, the sequence
      increases, e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, where the ratio is 2. If it is less
      than one, the sequence decreases, e.g., 1, 1/3, 1/9, 1/27, 1/81,
      where the ratio is 1/3.  
      Groups of bare lines whose spacing follows a geometric sequence are
      compelling and, to that extent, beautiful. Fig. 36 is graded
      according to a geometric sequence with a ratio of 0.7.  `

  function _95(md){return(
  md`#### Unequal Strength
  If the thickness of the parallel lines varies,
      it must be lawfully arranged if there are more than two. The
      thickest line is placed either at the edge of the group or in its
      center; in both cases, the other thicknesses are graded from that
      point in a lawful manner. Here, the spacings may be kept uniform or
      varied, but their law must correspond to that governing the
      thicknesses.  
      This touches upon the case where a design simultaneously confirms
      *multiple* laws, such as the law of thickness and that of
      spacings. How to proceed in such cases has already been stated:
      *The laws must correspond to one another* or prove mutually
      dependent. If, for example, the thicknesses decrease from one edge
      of the group to the other, then the spacings, if not kept uniform,
      must either increase or decrease accordingly. In the first case,
      both effects amplify each other; in the second, they counteract. One
      could implement the law that the line thicknesses and the intervals
      maintain a constant ratio, resulting in uniform brightness across
      the entire design. The observer is unlikely to immediately discern
      the law underlying this arrangement; however, the resulting pleasing
      impression is felt instantly.  
      This observation is also general. It suffices that a simple law
      underpins the design for the aesthetic impression to be experienced;
      recognition of the law is not necessary. The majority of art's
      effects are based on the application of such *"hidden laws."*  `

  The fundamental significance of lawfulness for aesthetic effect
      first became clear to me during my childhood, in the context of a
      geometric drawing assignment for school. We were tasked with
      illustrating how, by shifting a triangle along a ruler, *parallel
      lines* of any number could be drawn. It was customary to
      demonstrate various line styles (thick, thin, dashed, dotted, etc.).
      Finding the mere juxtaposition of these lines meaningless, I
      arranged them to represent, more or less, the transition between
      ceiling and wall with some moldings, bands, and so forth, which I
      observed around me. The drawing received special praise from the
      teacher. This unusual event spurred my reflections, and I consider
      this small attempt to be the first seed of the present work.`

  A group of parallel lines, which is held together by one
      of the specified laws, can itself be treated as a single line. For

      equal intervals, this constitutes the simplest such case. However,
      the groups can also be created according to differing laws and
      placed at unequal intervals.  
      These more complex cases are not mentioned because they are
      particularly important; rather, they occur only rarely. Their
      significance lies instead in demonstrating how lawfully composed
      structures can, in general, be treated in ornamental art as though
      they were simple form elements. This is a principle of very broad

      the simultaneously applied laws must correspond to one another,
      i.e., must contain consistent elements.  
      Moreover, the number of possibilities already becomes so vast at
      this point that listing them individually must be foregone.
      Additionally, modern viewers are so unaccustomed to encountering

  md`#### The True Braid 
  If multiple waves are multiplied along the same straight line by
      shifting, their lines intersect in the most varied ways. The
      arbitrariness inherent in this is eliminated in the same way as the
      dissonant jumble of different wavelengths in music---through the law
      that only waves with lengths equal to or in simple ratios to each
      other are combined. Similarly to how it took millennia in music to
      progress from unison of equal lengths to harmony of different
      lengths, spatial art still primarily confines itself to waves of
      equal lengths and identical fundamental forms, rarely using the
      ratio of 1:2, corresponding to the joint singing of female and male
      voices in the octave.
        
  We refer to such structures, based on the technical method by which
      they are most easily produced, as braids in the narrower sense. The
      *sine wave* serves as the fundamental form of braids. If a second
      wave is drawn parallel to the first and shifted by half a
      wavelength, the simplest form emerges, which does not yet resemble a
      braid, Fig. 38.  
      Fig. 38.  
      If, however, the wavelength is divided into three equal parts and
      three sine waves are overlaid, Fig. 39, a beautiful braid already
      forms, whose crossing points, as with all odd divisions, do not lie
      on the midline. Four equally spaced sine waves create a denser braid
      with division points on the midline. Rarely does one go beyond five
      or six.  
      Fig. 39.  
      Other braids can be created by applying the shifting law to the
      straight-line substitutes for the sine wave described on p. 28,
      e.g., Fig. 40, where each individual form, following special laws
      derived from its properties, can develop into particularly pleasing
      braids.  
      Fig. 40.  
      Beyond shifting in the main direction, other directional shifts are
      possible. Perpendicular to the main direction, the parallel line
      groups described on p. 30 are produced. Diagonal shifts can be
      broken down into two shifts, one aligned and the other perpendicular
      to the main direction. The simplest case here is a uniform shift by
      half a wavelength and a moderate shift perpendicular to it, Fig. 41.
      Through other lawful diagonal shifts, one can create attractive
      braids of great variety, which can further develop into surface
      coverings or weavings.

  md`#### Freer Braids  
  Any arbitrary waveform can be transformed into a braid through
      integral shifting, retaining the same characteristics regarding
      static or dynamic and single- or double-sided as the original form.
      With slightly more elaborate original forms, impressive braids can
      be achieved even with a shift of 1/2 wavelength, Fig. 42, which
      quickly become richer and more intricate with shifts of 1/3, 1/4,
      1/5. Simultaneously, the increasing lawfulness serves as a
      justification for any arbitrariness present in the original form,
      relegating questions about its rationale to the background.
      Particularly desirable here is a uniform or otherwise simply lawful
      filling of the entire area by the resulting line network. The course
      of the original form must be determined with this in mind. See the
      section after next for more on this.Fig. 42.  
      Beyond shifting in the longitudinal direction, diagonal shifting
      (p. 37) can naturally also be applied to free waves. Using it, any
      form, whether static or dynamic, results in a dynamic braid.  `

  md`#### Reflection
  If one attempts to utilize the sine wave through
      right-angle reflection or half-rotation to create new structures, it
      becomes apparent that no new results can be obtained in this way.
      The sine wave is mirror-symmetrical both left-to-right and
      top-to-bottom and is therefore impervious to such
      modifications.  
      Fig. 43    
  However, besides the vertical mirror line, one can also use a
      longitudinal mirror line. This already produces a simple braid in
      the sine wave, namely a duplication equivalent to a shift by half a
      wavelength (Fig. 38, p. 36). Any other wave likewise produces a
      duplication, thereby making it at least double-sided, and often also
      introducing an intersection, which frequently leads to good braids,
      Fig. 43. Here, the original form can already be somewhat intricate
      without significantly complicating the comprehension of the double
      form, as the repetition through reflection is so familiar to
      us.  
      Fig. 44    
  The position of the longitudinal mirror line does not necessarily
      have to be the midline, which in any case only exists in
      double-sided forms. Rather, each parallel creates a corresponding
      braid with this. This is a rich and flowing source of lawful
      modifications, Fig. 44.  
      Fig. 45.    
  Additionally, longitudinal reflection and shifting can be applied
      simultaneously, by shifting the entire mirror image by a specific
      fraction of the wavelength, Fig. 45. This method can be applied to
      dynamic as well as static, and single- or double-sided base forms.
      Each pattern becomes dynamic if the shift has a value other than
      half a wavelength.  `

  function _105(md){return(
  md`#### The Law of Equal Density
  Braids created from various base forms
      according to one of the specified laws possess significantly
      different artistic values. In particular, one might feel the need to
      add other lawful lines to areas where the lines are sparse compared
      to dense areas, in order to make the overall image appear more
      "harmonious."  
      This need reflects a very general artistic principle, which demands
      a *lawfully ordered fulfillment or coverage of the entire space
      intended for decoration*.  
      Again, the simplest fulfillment of this law is *uniformity*. This
      need is most easily satisfied by distributing the lines within the
      given space such that they are, on average, equally dense
      everywhere. A surface treated in this way appears uniformly colored
      when the lines blend into the background (through distance or a
      blurred focus).  
      However, uniformity is not the only way to fulfill the law. A
      well-ordered variation in density can take its place. For instance,
      if the braid is densest along the midline or an edge and then
      decreases in density according to a law, the eye is equally
      satisfied. The only requirement is that some form of lawfulness is
      clearly presented and executed without error or contradiction. This
      general principle is most clearly articulated by Hans Sachs in *Die
      Meistersinger*, where he expresses the universally applicable rule
      regarding artistic principles: "*You establish them yourself and
      then follow them.*"  
      There are two methods to achieve such lawfulness. One can either
      guide the line of the base form so that, once the braid is complete,
      the requirement is met. An example is the braid created by shifting
      the sine wave (p. 36), which results in equal density.
      Alternatively, one can add other forms—dots, circles, stars,
      rosettes, or even free shapes that resonate with existing forms—to
      areas that are too sparsely covered, thereby achieving proper
      coverage. The second method is more arbitrary and comes with its
      respective advantages and disadvantages.`

  function _106(md){return(

  A second method of doubling a given wave line
      involves rotating a wave segment by 1/2 around a suitably chosen
      point and extending this new form through translation. Together with
      the original form, this creates the simplest two-stranded braid.
      This braid is double-sided, even if the original form was
      single-sided, while retaining its dynamic or static nature, Fig. 46.  
  By translating by 1/2, 1/3, etc., of the wavelength, more intricate
      braids can be achieved, without changing their dynamic or static
      nature.  
      Fig. 46.

  By bands, we understand those forms that are elongated in one

      patterns). Due to their planar components, they are much more
      diverse than lines and braids and are governed by laws that partly
      originate from the domain of planar harmonics. However, these laws
      only manifest in their simpler expressions, making the study of
      bands a practical transition to the examination of planes in the
      narrower sense.  
      Bands are also connected to lines through braids. In braids, the
      multiple crossings of lines delimit *planar* sections, which can
      be treated as independent entities (e.g., through color), thereby

  We start with an entirely arbitrary planar form in which no
      regularity exists, meaning no part is identical or similar (in a

      serves as examples. The fact that such forms can produce primitive
      aesthetic effects is demonstrated by the well-known method of
      klecksography. By folding a sheet of paper after making an ink blot
      on one side and pressing it to ensure it transfers to the opposite
      side, one creates a mirror form upon opening the paper, which
      produces a primitively pleasing impression, Fig. 48.

  md`#### Pure Form Art
  A free form without regularity has no inherent aesthetic value. It
      can acquire such value by representing an object from the external
      world that we find beautiful for certain reasons. However, this is
      not an immediate form value but an indirect one, arising from
      association or memory. For example, the silhouette of a woman's
      head, when viewed in a normal position, evokes a feeling of
      pleasure. But if we view the same form after rotating it by 1/4 or
      1/2 turn, possibly before recognizing what it represents, it leaves
      us as indifferent as any other blot.  
        
  This book deliberately sets aside such associative values, focusing
      exclusively on the study of pure form harmonics. That a form art
      without such associative values is possible and can even reach a
      very high level of development is demonstrated by music, which
      undoubtedly evokes much stronger emotional responses than visual
      art, without depicting any objects from the external world. Just as
      music, in a broader sense, is a pure form art, we can envision a
      pure form (and color) art for the eye, which in the future (once it
      incorporates the possibility of temporal change) could enter into
      superior competition with music. At present, we are at its very
      beginnings, and this book aims (alongside the similarly purposed
      „Harmony of Colors*"*) to bring clarity to the foundations of a pure
      visual or light-based art.  `

  function _112(md){return(
  md`#### The Basic Elements of Form Art
  For us to perceive coherence, regularity, and thus beauty in a form, a relationship between the
      various parts of this form is required.  
      Since the "meaning" of the form and its parts has been explicitly
      excluded, *repetition* remains the sole means of establishing
      relationships.  
      General psychology identifies the recollection of the same, i.e.,
      the sensation of repetition, as a fundamental characteristic of all
      living beings. From this, we promptly conclude that clarifying this
      concept indeed provides the key to solving our task.  
      Repetition of a form consists of creating it a second time with all
      its formal properties, such as boundary, size, and arrangement of
      parts, so that only the difference in spatial position remains as a
      distinction.  
      Repetition can initially be executed entirely freely at another
      location. However, a beautiful result is generally not achieved due
      to the lack of regularity. Alternatively, it can be related to the
      original form in a lawful manner. In such cases, we may expect an
      aesthetic effect.  
      Lawful repetition initially presents itself in the three forms we
      have come to know as *translation*, *rotation*, and
      *reflection*. These have already been briefly described; here,
      they will be examined in greater detail. The inclusion of
      repetitions is intentional. The relationships are so
      essential---forming the foundation of the entire theory of
      forms---that their secure understanding necessitates this
      reiteration.  
      It should be noted in advance that this discussion is limited to
      forms in the *plane*; the repetition, too, is to lie within the
      same, infinitely extending plane. `
  )}
  
  function _113(md){return(
  md`#### Translation
  Translation occurs when the corresponding points of
      the original and the duplicate form are equidistant from one
      another. In this case, the connecting lines between such points are
      necessarily not only of equal length but also parallel.  
      A translation is characterized by the length and direction of these
      parallel lines. These two variables must be regulated lawfully to
      meet aesthetic requirements.  
      In the case of bands discussed here, the direction of the
      translation is determined by the longitudinal direction of the band.
      The distance is defined by conditions often external to the band,
      namely within the overall form to which the band belongs. Typically,
      this distance should be a small fraction, 1/5 or less, of the band's
      length.  
      The reason for this is that translation in a band must not occur
      just once but multiple times at the same intervals for the
      regularity to become evident. Therefore, the number of repetitions
      must be indefinite, meaning not countable at a glance.  
      Thus, the general method of decorating bands involves the
      equidistant repetition of a free fundamental form along the band's
      direction through translation.  
      Due to the consistent orientation of all parts of the form in a
      translation, this type of repetition is the easiest to understand.
      It thus has the strongest initial impact but risks becoming overly
      simplistic and therefore boring. As such, it is found in the early
      stages of decorative art or ornamentation as a universally applied
      method, further recommended by its simplicity of technical
      execution.`

  md`#### The Lateral Characteristics of Bands  
  When a band is created through equidistant translation of a form, it
      can be differentiated into left and right, as well as top and
      bottom, assuming the band runs from left to right, with "top" and
      "bottom" referring to its edges. If the generating form is free, the
      band initially differs on the right and left sides. Such a pattern
      is called *continuous*.  
      Furthermore, the band also differs at the top and bottom if the form
      is free. This characteristic is called *one-sidedness*. Both
      properties are present and generate distinct effects on the
      perception of the band, which must be carefully considered when
      striving for aesthetic value.`
  )}
  
  function _115(md){return(
  md`#### Multiple Distances 
  In addition to equidistant translation, the case of a lawful
      variation in distances is noteworthy. If *a*represents the distance,
      then *a a a a...* or simply *a* serves as the symbol for
      equidistance. If we denote another distance as *b*, we can construct
      bands as *a b a b a b...* or simply *a b*, as well as *a b a*, *a a
      b b*, *a a a b*, and so on. In each case, the repeating unit *a b*,
      *a b a*, *a a b b*, *a a a b*, etc., can be regarded as a complete
      form, from which the band is created through equidistant
      translation.  
      This concept of formation, where a basic element is first combined
      into a lawfully structured group, which is then treated as a unit
      according to a distinct formative principle that may differ from but
      is formally analogous to the initial one, has already been applied
      (p. 34) and will frequently recur. It generates harmonies of the
      second and higher orders from those of the first order.  `

  function _116(md){return(
  md`#### Variable Translation
  According to the fundamental theorem of
      form harmonics, the governing law must visibly manifest in the
      design to achieve a beautiful effect.  
      If unequal distances are to be introduced, they must be lawfully
      justified. The simplest rule for varying distances appears to be the
      numerical sequence; thus, the basic form would be repeated at
      distances of *1, 2, 3, 4,...*. However, it has already been shown
      for linear distances that this does not lead to practical results.
      When a band is created following this arithmetic sequence, it
      appears unconvincing. A geometric or logarithmic progression, where
      distances change not by equal amounts but by equal ratios, proves to
      be much more suitable.  
      This is yet another special case of Fechner's law, which states that
      perception progresses in equal steps when stimuli change according
      to a geometric series.  
      I am not aware of any practical attempt at such a band division. Its
      application would be appropriate where a band concludes and the
      impression of a gradual fading out is to be achieved.  `
  )}
  
  function _117(md){return(
  md`#### Loose and Connected Forms
  The individual form that is repeated
      within the band can either be self-contained, with no connection to
      the subsequent repetition, or it can extend on both sides to the
      boundary of the neighboring form in such a way that the extensions
      meet or partially overlap. The closest connection is achieved when
      the converging boundary lines merge seamlessly without breaks or
      abrupt angles. In this case, the repetitions appear as components of
      a single connected form, which can be extended to any length and
      divided into identical segments starting from any point.  
      Additionally, the question of partial overlap of the form deserves
      attention. If the translation distance is smaller than the length of
      the fundamental form, such partial overlap occurs, thereby ensuring
      continuous connection of the overall form. This yields practical
      aesthetic values. If the distance is larger, each individual form
      remains separate. When distances lawfully increase or decrease, one
      case transitions into the other, which can, in some circumstances,
      create a unique appeal.  `
  )}
  
  function _118(md){return(
  md`#### Alignment
  When designing a cohesive pattern, ensuring the
      alignment (rapport) is straightforward and accurate can be achieved
      for planar forms in the same way as described for linear forms.
      After deciding on the general shape, start drawing from the left
      edge. Once approximately 1/4 or 1/3 of the field is completed,
      immediately repeat the initial drawing in the next field. This makes
      it easy to complete the drawing up to the right edge and establish
      alignment with the second part already present. The same rules apply
      to the boundary lines of cohesive planar forms as outlined above
      (p. 15) for lines, namely, that they must merge seamlessly without
      breaks or abrupt angles.  
      However, this rule represents only the simplest or most lawful
      solution to the problem. For specific reasons, one may deviate from
      it and utilize the breaks created at the alignment points for
      particular effects. The next law offered here is the right angle.  `
  )}
  
  function _119(md){return(
  md`#### Rotation
  A shape undergoes pure rotation when a fixed center of
      rotation is defined within its plane, and all its points move in
      circles around this center, always sweeping through equal angles.  
      Thus, we have two degrees of freedom: the choice of the center of
      rotation and the angle of rotation. Let us first consider the
      angle.  
      When the shape is rotated until it returns to its original position
      (which is always possible), all its points will have completed a
      full circle, and the angle is equal to one full rotation, which we
      take as the natural unit. Consequently, we reject the long-outdated
      measurement of angles in 360 degrees. A right angle is therefore
      1/4, as four of them constitute a full rotation. The angle of a
      regular triangle is 1/6, that of a regular hexagon is 1/3, and that
      of a regular n-gon is (n-2)/2n.  
      We consider only integral rotations, where the shape returns to its
      original position after 2, 3, 4 ... n rotations.  `
  )}
  
  function _120(md){return(
  md`#### Properties of Rotation
  A pure rotation is characterized by its
      center of rotation and its angle of rotation. If the center lies
      within the shape, a cohesive, approximately saw-blade-shaped form
      emerges, with uniformly oriented rays or leaves. If the center is
      outside the shape, ring-like to loosely connected forms arise,
      depending on whether the individual shapes partially overlap or not.
      (In the first case, overlap always occurs.) By moving the center of
      rotation inside or outside the shape, an infinite number of
      different overall forms can be created.  
      The angle of rotation must be integral, as no finite figure results
      otherwise. This means that after a finite number of rotations by the
      same angle, the shape must exactly return to its original position.
      The angle of rotation is therefore represented by the formula 1/n,
      where n is an integer. For our purposes, the numbers n = 2, 3, 4, 5,
      6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 are relevant, with 7 being rarely used by us but
      frequently in Chinese ornamentation. Higher numbers are not uncommon
      but can no longer be counted at a glance, thus lacking distinct
      character.  
      Apart from rotations by equal angles, rotations by different angles
      can also be performed. The simplest lawful case is alternating two
      different rotations, *a* and *b*, such that *a + b* together form a
      two-, three-, four-, or more generally an integral rotation; in
      other words, *a + b = 1/n*.  
      Instead of a simple alternation *a b*, more complex patterns can be
      applied, as explained on p. 12 for divisions. However, the angle of
      the composite element must always be integral.  
      A shape created by a complete rotation is called a *turnling*.  
      The shapes formed from a free form through pure rotation, or
      turnlings, are just as continuous as those created by pure
      translation, meaning they exhibit a different configuration
      clockwise than counterclockwise. For every such turnling, however,
      there exists a counterpart. This counterpart does not arise by
      simply performing the rotation in the opposite direction. The only
      aspect that may differ is the inner outline within the composite
      shape in cases of partial overlap, assuming a distinction is made
      between an upper and a lower part. However, the outer outline of the
      composite shape remains unchanged.  
      Rather, the counterpart arises only through reflection, and it makes
      no difference whether the original form is reflected first and then
      used to generate the turnling or whether the entire turnling is
      first created and then reflected.  `
  )}
  
  function _121(md){return(
  md`#### Reflection
  The third case of the lawful repetition of a planar
      form is reflection. This occurs as follows: An infinite line is
      assumed in some position relative to the given form, and from every
      point of the form, a perpendicular is drawn to the line and extended
      to the opposite side by the same distance.  
      The set of endpoints of these perpendiculars then creates a
      repetition of the shape, where all lengths and angles are preserved,
      but their orientation is reversed. This relationship is familiar
      from the comparison of the right and left hand; it generally exists
      between an object and its image in a flat mirror. Hence, the
      relationship between the two forms produced in this manner is called
      *mirror image*, and the process that creates this second form is
      called reflection.  
      Reflection fundamentally differs from translation and rotation in
      that the form does not remain identical to itself but instead
      reverses its order. For this reason, the original form and its
      mirror image are generally not congruent (overlapping) or made to
      overlap through translation and rotation. Only if the original form
      is itself a mirror image does it remain congruent under reflection.
      While the right half becomes the left and the left becomes the
      right, the overall form does not change because both were
      mirror-symmetric from the start.  
      Additionally, the difference lies in the impossibility of infinite
      repetition, as in translation, or finite repetition, as in rotation.
      The mirror image of a mirror image along the same line coincides
      with the original form, creating a closed duality beyond which no
      further repetition occurs.  `
  )}
  
  function _122(md){return(
  md`#### Variables
  In reflection, there are again two variables: the
      position of the mirror relative to the given free form,
      characterized by the angle the mirror line (briefly called the
      mirror) forms with a fixed line within the shape, and secondly, the
      distance of the mirror from the form. These variables allow for a
      twofold infinity of possible reflections.  
      For bands, two mirror positions are considered. Either the mirror
      line lies in the longitudinal direction of the band, in which case
      the reflection creates a bilateral form, with the mirror line
      running along the center of the band, or the mirror lies
      perpendicular to the band direction. In the latter case, only a
      mirrored form of double length results. In both scenarios, an
      infinitely long band cannot be created; translation is always
      required for this.  `
  )}
  
  function _123(md){return(
  md`#### Mirror Symmetry
  When a shape and its mirror image are combined
      into a single composite form, such mirror images are referred to as
      mirror-symmetric. The mirror line, which plays a significant role in
      the composite form due to its symmetric arrangement on both sides,
      is called the *main line*. [1] It is often referred to as the
      axis of symmetry. However, since the term "axis" suggests rotation
      rather than reflection, it is impractical and must be avoided here.
      The mirror line does not necessarily need to be explicitly visible
      within the composite form and usually is not.  
      Mirror-symmetric forms have the property of remaining *unchanged*
      under reflection (p. 51). Therefore, the outcome of the reflection
      can also be achieved through translation and rotation.`
  )}
  
  function _124(md){return(
  md`#### Translation and Rotation
  We now turn to higher-level form
      harmonies that arise from the combination of two types of
      repetition. Since there are three types—translation, rotation, and
      reflection—there are also three possible pairs: translation and
      rotation, translation and reflection, rotation and reflection.  
      The first case is most easily realized when the center of rotation
      lies at the endpoint of the original form, the rotation is 1/2, and
      the translation equals the length of the composite form. The two
      rotational positions then alternate regularly.  
      The picture becomes more diverse when a double form is created from
      the original form and its repetition, rotated around a different
      point, and this double form is then repeated by translation.
      Depending on the choice of the center of rotation and the distance,
      many derivatives of the given form can be developed.  
      In the case of bands, the translation must follow the band
      direction, and the center of rotation should be chosen such that no
      overly pronounced lateral projections occur—ideally, it should lie
      somewhere along the centerline of the band. If a different rotation
      angle, such as 1/3, 1/4, etc., is chosen, the resulting forms may be
      more challenging to interpret, which can sometimes enhance their
      appeal.  
      With rotational translation, a continuous pattern remains
      continuous; a one-sided pattern, however, becomes bilateral if the
      rotation is even, such as 1/2, 1/4, 1/6. In other cases, it remains
      one-sided.  
      An illustration of these cases is unnecessary, as the essential
      aspects can be derived from the corresponding linear structures (p.
      36). The same applies to the subsequent sections.  `
  )}
  
  function _125(md){return(
  md`#### Unequal Rotation and Translation
  A further diversity arises
      when the distances are alternated according to the rule *a b*, *a a
      b*, *a a a b*, etc. An additional order is introduced if the
      rotations are also performed according to the same sequence.  
      If the distances change according to a logarithmic series,
      simultaneous rotation of the basic shape becomes difficult to
      comprehend, except possibly in the case of twofold symmetry. Such
      cases should therefore be approached with great caution.  `
  )}
  
  function _126(md){return(
  md`#### Translation and Reflection
  In the case of a band, the mirror
      line can lie either in the longitudinal or the transverse
      direction.  
      If the mirror is perpendicular to the band direction, a
      mirror-symmetric double form is created, which is repeated
      equidistantly through translation. This converts a previously
      continuous form into a static one, while any existing one-sidedness
      remains.  
      If the form is mirrored along a longitudinal mirror, a reflected
      shape appears alongside the original, forming a mirror image whose
      main line runs along the band direction. This form is repeated
      through translation. As a result, the one-sidedness disappears,
      while the continuous motion remains.  
      Additionally, the mirrored form can be shifted and then combined
      with the original form.  
      In all cases, lawful variations in distances can also be applied.  `
  )}
  
  function _127(md){return(
  md`#### Parallel Mirrors
  If a second mirror is placed parallel to the
      first, the original form, along with its first mirror image, is
      reflected again. These forms are then reflected back in the first
      mirror, and so on. The result is an infinite band in which the
      original shape and its mirror image alternate regularly at intervals
      equal to twice the distance between the two mirrors.  
      This band differs from one produced solely by translation due to its
      mirror symmetry; its form is static. In other words, it creates the
      same pattern as the combination of translation and reflection along
      the band direction.  `
  )}
  
  function _128(md){return(
  md`#### Rotation and Reflection
  If a given free form is transformed into
      a mirror image, it can subsequently be turned into a turnling
      through integral rotation. Fundamentally different patterns emerge
      depending on whether the center of rotation lies outside or within
      the main axis.  
      In the first case, the resulting turnling is not significantly
      different from one derived from a free form and requires no special
      description.  
      The second case, however, where the center of rotation lies
      somewhere along the main axis, is of utmost importance, as this
      principle forms the basis for most circular or star-shaped
      patterns.  
      Such a turnling consists of several mirror-symmetric segments, whose
      main axes all intersect at the center of the overall form. Due to
      the symmetry of its parts, the form is static.  
      According to the division of rotations, we have two-, three-, four-,
      five-, or higher-numbered mirror-symmetric turnlings. They are
      commonly referred to as rosettes; however, we prefer the shorter and
      more common \\[deutscheren\\] term *roses*, which has long been used
      for the same patterns in Gothic art.  
      Only in the simplest case, with twofold rotation, might one hesitate
      to use this term because such forms typically have one longer and
      one shorter main axis that intersect at right angles. Nevertheless,
      even the threefold mirror-symmetric turnling is readily called a
      rose. We also adapt to using the term for twofold roses, which are
      fully comparable to the three-, four-, and up to twelvefold roses.
      Fig. 53 illustrates a twofold, a threefold, and a fivefold rose, all
      derived from the same basic form.  
      Rotation and reflection produce only roses but not bands; for that,
      translation is essential.  `
  )}
  
  function _129(md){return(
  md`#### Angle Mirrors
  Pattern designers and applied artists frequently
      use angle mirrors to create centrally organized patterns. It is well
      known that the mirror angle must be set not only to an integral
      fraction but also to an even rotation fraction, such as 1/2, 1/4,
      1/6, 1/8, 1/10, etc., or generally to 1/2n, as no closed forms can
      be produced otherwise.  
      Upon closer examination, it becomes evident that these patterns are
      invariably roses. The free form placed within the mirror angle,
      along with its mirror image, forms a mirror image pair whose main
      line passes through the mirror axis. This image is reflected in the
      other mirror and back in the first, and so on.  
      With a mirror angle of 1/2n, an n-fold turnling is created,
      consisting of n mirror-symmetric segments whose main lines all
      intersect at the same rotation point. This is, in essence, the
      definition of a rose.  `
  )}
  
  function _130(md){return(
  md`#### Reflection of a Continuous Turnling
  The reflection of a
      continuous turnling is a similar, yet counter-rotating turnling. The
      combination of these two forms illustrates the simple principle that
      no other types of such forms exist; this approach is very frequently
      and gladly employed. It is particularly useful in cases where the
      dynamic effect of a continuous form is desired without imposing the
      unidirectionality inherent to a continuous turnling upon the overall
      design.  
      The same counterpart can be achieved by reflecting only the base
      form instead of the entire turnling and then creating a turnling
      from this reflected base according to the same principle.  `
  )}
  
  function _131(md){return(
  md`#### Translation, Rotation, and Reflection
  The combination of these
      three principles of formation results in bands composed of a series
      of roses. Such a band, with even-numbered rotations, shows no
      variation either horizontally or vertically, and thus represents a
      pinnacle of orderliness. It is widely applied wherever serene beauty
      in organization is intended to be expressed.  
      Due to this degree of orderliness, which may seem excessive to
      modern sensibilities, such a band of roses requires an enhanced
      level of artistic or coloristic appeal to adequately capture
      attention.  `
  )}
  
  function _132(md){return(
  md`#### Edges and Center
  In band patterns, there is almost always a
      need to treat the edges and the central area differently. Even
      during the technical production of bands, such as weaving, specific
      effects appear at the edges, which also influence the pattern
      design. Naturally, simpler forms, such as straight lines or rows of
      dots, are placed at the edges, while the interior is given a richer
      design.  
      Generally, the continuous or static character of the pattern in the
      central area is also maintained at the edges. For example, if the
      main pattern runs to the right, the edge would not be made to run
      leftward unless a specific effect is desired. However, the edge can
      be treated as static, as this does not create a conflict with the
      dynamic center.  
      Similarly, the longitudinal divisions of the combined patterns must
      align, either by being identical or in a simple ratio, such as 1:2
      or 1:3. The smaller sections belong at the edge, as they are less
      visually impactful than larger ones.  `

  function _133(md){return(
  md`#### Combining Multiple Forms
  When filling a band with planar forms
      according to the principle of equal density (p. 39), it is often
      necessary to fill empty spaces not touched by the main form with
      subordinate forms.  
      These auxiliary forms are best chosen to be related to the main
      form, most simply as parts of the same form. Their spacing either
      matches that of the main form or is a simple fraction thereof.  
      Apart from this need to combine multiple forms into a band, the
      desire for diversity may also lead to such combinations. The general
      rules remain the same. Usually, two forms are combined; more than
      three are impractical due to a lack of clarity.  `
  )}
  
  function _134(md){return(
  md`#### Loosened Forms
  The previously described forms, when executed
      with precision, such as by machine, often appear rigid and lifeless.
      This is because, although countless repetitive forms exist in
      nature—for instance, all individuals of a species, such as hares
      or cabbage butterflies—they still differ within certain limits,
      thereby achieving diversity in unity.  
      When those strict spatial forms are *crafted by hand*, small,
      unintended variations arise, similar to those found in natural
      entities, thereby producing the charm that such items exert
      (currently in an exaggerated manner). Conversely, for those less
      exposed to machine culture, the precision of machine work represents
      a positive aesthetic appeal. The uniformity of repetition, perceived
      entirely as such within the threshold of distinction, evokes a sense
      of technical perfection, which initially held significant aesthetic
      value and still does in more primitive cultures today.  
      Only the modern person, oversaturated with machine-made products,
      feels the sentimental allure that mirrors the call of Rousseau over
      a century ago: *back to nature*, which today resonates as *back
      to craftsmanship*. Both movements are equally unclear and
      unhealthy. Humanity's path of development cannot be reversed. If we
      perceive a deficiency–and such a sentiment always underlies these
      attitudes–then we must look forward to addressing it on our path
      ahead.  
      Instead of seeking sentimentally insincere forms, as was done 150
      years ago, to evoke an idyllic connection to nature, we must find
      ways to address the existing need objectively, in line with forward
      development, as exemplified by the Garden City movement. Similarly,
      in the applied arts, we must not revert to primitive manufacturing
      methods that allow the production of utility objects only with
      unwarranted waste of energy. Instead, we must learn to loosen and
      enliven the overly rigid templates of the machine through improved
      and diversified machine operations.  
      How untruthful the current Werkbund practices can occasionally
      become due to this sentimentality–despite all the rhetoric about
      material authenticity and integrity of craft–became painfully
      clear to me years ago. One of the most successful collaborators in
      this field showed me a rather well-executed, simple home interior
      and drew my attention to the door hinges. These, he explained, were
      standard machine-stamped products; however, through irregular blows
      with a sharp hammer, they had been given the appearance of
      hand-forged door hinges and were thus aesthetically refined. Here,
      the principle of integrity was deliberately violated in favor of
      craftsmanship sentimentality. And any connoisseur of this movement
      knows this was not an isolated case.  `

  md`#### Degrees of Loosening
  The loosening of rigid forms can be
      implemented in several stages. Initially, this is achieved by
      altering the spacing or proportions of the repeating forms without
      abandoning the fundamental lawfulness of the repetition itself.
      Additionally, the base form can be varied within certain limits.  
      A further loosening occurs when individual forms are replaced with
      others that do not strictly adhere to the original lawfulness but
      maintain a certain affinity with it. Finally, the most extensive
      loosening involves introducing randomness, where the underlying
      lawfulness remains intact, but the details of the design are no
      longer predetermined.  `
  )}
  
  function _136(md){return(
  md`#### Retention of the Framework
  Another degree of freedom is as
      follows: the rectangular (or skewed) sections into which the band is
      divided by evenly spaced transverse lines are filled with various
      but stylistically consistent forms.  
      The most economical approach involves alternating just two different
      fillings; however, in this case, the repetition is still generally
      perceived as such. With three different fillings, a sense of freedom
      begins to emerge, and with four, it is nearly fully realized.  
      A special charm arises when the different forms are not chosen
      randomly but express a specific regularity in their variation. The
      repeatedly utilized symbolism of the four seasons is a well-known
      example; however, lawful variations of a pure idea of form and color
      are more appropriate.  `
  )}
  
  function _137(md){return(
  md`#### Equidistant Points 
  A greater degree of loosening occurs when the band pattern includes
      only equidistant recurring points marked by a distinctive shape
      (star, polygon, cross, circle, etc.), while the remaining space is
      filled with free forms. By emphasizing these recurring forms more or
      less prominently, the adhered-to rule can be emphasized or
      downplayed, providing a means to evoke any desired impression of
      regularity or freedom. However, care must be taken to avoid letting
      the free forms overshadow the legally repeated ones, as this would
      create a perceived contradiction to the rule, resulting in
      disharmony.  `
  )}
  
  function _138(md){return(
  md`#### Equidistant Free Areas
  One can also forgo the recurring form
      elements described above and limit the uniform repetition to the
      lawful variation of the general treatment of the pattern. For
      instance, loose and dense arrangements of alternating pattern
      components can be alternated regularly; the same applies to varying
      the predominant direction of the lines or the prevailing color, and
      so on.  `
  )}
  
  function _139(md){return(
  md`#### Uniform Distribution
  Perhaps the smallest degree of lawfulness
      still capable of producing aesthetic effects is the approximately
      uniform distribution of a surface with an otherwise free pattern.
      This is a commonly applied method, suitable when the area in
      question is not intended to stand out but should not suffer from the
      monotony of complete uniformity. An example is sprinkling a
      whitewashed wall with droplets of another color, which appear random
      individually but evenly distributed overall.  
      This principle of uniform distribution is also applicable to all
      previously discussed cases. In general, we find the form of a filled
      pattern more pleasant the more the variety of used shapes conforms
      to the law of equal density. As in many other cases, resolving the
      contradiction between opposing demands---diversity of forms on the
      one hand, uniformity of spatial distribution on the other---directly
      generates aesthetic pleasure and is thus an important artistic
      tool.  
      More challenging than achieving equal density is implementing lawful
      variable density (e.g., decreasing from the central axis toward the
      edges) within otherwise free form arrangements. However,
      successfully achieving this creates a unique charm.  
      With this, the smallest possible degree of lawfulness for bands is
      reached.  `

  md`#### Unlimited and Limited Surfaces
  The following investigations
      address the lawfulness of forms or shapes on a *plane*. The
      restriction to planar surfaces is primarily due to their simplicity,
      making their relationships easier to comprehend. Furthermore, it is
      not difficult to transfer planar patterns to other types of surfaces
      while preserving their lawful relationships and aesthetic values.
      Guidance for this will be provided later.  
      The plane to be adorned with lawful forms can be either unlimited or
      limited. Wallpaper, for example, displays an unlimited pattern; it
      can be extended or reduced as needed without the boundaries
      affecting its aesthetic impact, aside from mechanical limits. A
      carpet, on the other hand, exhibits a limited pattern, often
      featuring a *frame*, a *central field*, and intervening *corner
      elements*. Such a carpet cannot be arbitrarily cut or extended
      without destroying the aesthetic value of its pattern. Where such
      treatment is required, such as for fully covering a floor, the
      carpet should be equipped with an unlimited pattern.  
      Since unlimited patterns allow for simpler theoretical treatment,
      they will be considered first.  `

  md`#### Derivation of Infinite Surface Patterns from Bands
  While the previously considered lines, braids, and bands extend in *one*
      direction, the plane possesses two dimensions. If we place on the
      plane a linear pattern, braid, or band that is infinite, i.e., as
      long as the plane itself, it will only fill a strip of the plane,
      leaving the rest uncovered. To completely cover the plane, the strip
      must be repeated lawfully. This requires a translation in a
      direction perpendicular to its orientation. However, it does not
      necessarily need to be perpendicular; any other angle will suffice.
      The perpendicular is merely a special case with unique properties,
      occurring only once as a "distinguished" case.  
      The lawful translation must occur in both directions if the strip is
      initially laid arbitrarily across the plane. If it is placed along
      the edge from the outset, translation need only occur in one
      direction. We define once and for all that the entire plane must be
      covered by transverse translations.  
      By considering all specific cases of lines, braids, and bands
      discussed in the first part of this book as placed on the plane and
      subjecting them to all possible translations, one arrives at all the
      ways a plane can be infinitely patterned through translation.  
      In addition to translation, there are also rotation and reflection.
      After conducting this initial investigation, it will still be
      necessary to identify the possible cases that arise through these
      methods. However, since both processes only produce bounded shapes,
      they will not create varieties equivalent to translation for
      infinite planes but will instead affect only the closed shapes from
      which the infinite pattern is constructed through repetition.  `
  )}
  
  function _143(md){return(
  md`#### The Stripe Pattern
  When applying the described method lawfully,
      the first and simplest case is the line, which is shifted parallel
      to itself in a transverse direction by equal amounts. Here, the
      direction of the shift has no influence, as the line exhibits no
      variations in its extension. The only new variable is the
      *spacing*, which is measured perpendicularly.  
      The simplest planar pattern thus consists of an indefinite number of
      parallel stripes of equal width. It is usually not characterized by
      lines alone but by the fact that the stripes alternately or
      otherwise lawfully display internal variations. These variations are
      most often in *color* but can also include other differences, such
      as the weave structure in textiles.  
      Even this simplest pattern allows for many variations, starting with
      the stripe *width*. The upper and lower limits are defined by the
      production process and intended use, but there is typically a
      significant range in between. Additionally, the *orientation* of
      the stripes can be adjusted relative to a notable direction (e.g.,
      vertical for wall decorations, clothing, furniture, etc.) in various
      ways: aligned, transverse, or diagonal.  
      Initially, it is assumed that stripes of uniform width are used.
      However, there is no obstacle to employing multiple spacings and
      varying them lawfully, such as following sequences like ab, abc, or
      abac. This increases the variety of the earlier cases accordingly.  
      It is initially assumed that stripes of *equal* width are used.
      However, there is no obstacle to using multiple widths and
      alternating them lawfully according to patterns such as *ab*, *abc*,
      *abac*, etc. This correspondingly multiplies the earlier cases.  
      Instead of the straight lines used so far, any *wavy line* can
      also be applied. Here, the *direction* of the translation
      introduces a new variable. Depending on the type of wave and the
      direction of the translation, very different planar fillings can be
      achieved. All the variations previously developed for wavy lines
      (p. 18) can be applied here and further diversified by altering the
      magnitude and direction of the translation. Additionally, there are
      possibilities regarding the structure of the lines (thin, thick,
      dotted, dashed, etc.).  
      Fig. 56.  
      To illustrate some of these variations with a simple example, Figs.
      54 through 57 show a sine wave shifted downward by equal widths; the
      differences are solely based on variations in direction. In Fig. 54,
      the translation is perpendicular to the sine wave\\'s path. In Fig.
      55, it is oblique, with each step shifting 1/12 of the wavelength to
      the right; in Fig. 56, it shifts by 1/4, and in Fig. 57, by 1/2 of
      the wavelength.  
      Fig. 57.  
      The visual distinction of the stripes is not limited to the creation
      of the lines themselves. A very common and effective method is to
      color the stripes with alternating colors arranged lawfully. The
      lines then appear as boundaries between the colors, which can
      optionally be further emphasized (with gold, black, white, etc.).  `

  function _144(md){return(
  md`#### The Braided Pattern
  The considerations just discussed apply
      initially to simple lines. However, they can also be appropriately
      extended to braids. By placing an infinitely long braid on the plane
      and lawfully shifting it laterally, the entire plane can be covered
      with adjacent braid strips.  
      A greater aesthetic appeal, however, is exerted by braided patterns
      that exhibit connections not only in one direction but also in the
      other. These arise when the lines are shifted transversely to their
      direction so that they partially overlap. This shifting can be done
      equidistantly, which represents the simplest case, or it can follow
      a lawful variation, resulting in a much greater variety. Figs. 56
      and 57 illustrate such overlaps.  `

  function _145(md){return(
  md`#### The Band Pattern
  Continuing the line of thought lawfully, we
      now consider filling the plane with *bands* through lateral
      shifting. A band consists of the single repetition of a particular
      form, with or without alignment. When the band is shifted laterally,
      double repetitions of the same form are created, legally filling the
      entire plane.  
      This leads us from the study of bands to the more general question
      of the lawful filling of the plane.  `

  function _146(md){return(
  md`#### Loose and Coherent Forms
  When observing a given surface, it can
      be viewed in two ways: either as a bounded entity, i.e., as a
      self-contained unit, or as a part of an unbounded structure that
      extends beyond the visible surface in all directions.  
      In the first case, the main question is whether the bounded segment
      possesses its own character and is coherent in itself, or if it is
      merely an arbitrary fragment of the unbounded whole. In the latter
      scenario, one will usually strive to provide it with coherence by
      completing it or selecting another piece.  
      In the other case, the task is to discern the lawfulness of the
      unbounded structure, with the primary question being whether this
      lawfulness is immediately apparent or requires certain
      circumstances, such as detailed investigation or magnification, to
      become evident.  `
  )}
  
  function _147(md){return(
  md`#### Loose and Tiling Forms
  Summarizing what has been discussed so
      far, the following general method emerges for the lawful covering of
      an infinite plane. By translating any given shape in one direction,
      infinite bands are created; by translating these bands in a second
      direction, the infinite plane is covered.  
      The shape subjected to this double translation can range from
      entirely free to perfectly lawful; notably, it can itself already
      have been generated by lawful repetition of a simpler shape through
      translation, rotation, or reflection.  
      Even a completely arbitrary shape produces simple aesthetic values
      through such double translation, as this translation represents the
      most general lawfulness possible in an infinite plane. There is
      freedom in the choice of shape, the two distances, and the angle
      between the two directions. However, these freedoms must be
      regulated lawfully to achieve meaningful results.  
      The described method of covering the plane generally produces a
      *loose* pattern, meaning one in which the repeated shape does not
      completely fill the plane. Thus, one distinguishes between the
      background or ground and the pattern. The well-known "scattered
      floral" pattern is an example of this. However, because the
      decorative shape is repeated, the associated background also repeats
      within certain boundaries. By combining both into a single unit, the
      overall form, the space becomes completely filled. This overall form
      then repeats through double translation according to the same laws
      as the decorative shape. It divides the plane into identical,
      free-standing sections with the unique property of filling the plane
      seamlessly when assembled into an infinite pattern. Such forms are
      called *tiling* forms.  
      The study of decorating infinite planes can thus be traced back to
      the study of tiling forms as its foundation. By classifying and
      organizing tiling forms, we gain an overview of all possibilities
      available for infinite decorative patterns. The previously discussed
      cases of stripes and braids can be seen as simplified special cases
      of tiling forms. Their separate treatment was appropriate because
      their simplicity facilitates the understanding of more complex
      relationships.  `

  function _148(md){return(
  md`#### Nets
  *Nets* serve as the basis for further investigations and
      are constructed as follows: The plane is covered with a set of
      equidistant parallel lines, and another set of equidistant parallel
      lines is superimposed at an angle to the first. This arrangement
      divides the plane coherently into parallelograms that are congruent
      and equally oriented. The entirety forms a net; the intersection
      points are called *nodes*, and the fundamental shape is referred
      to as the *mesh*.  
      The described net of parallelograms is the most general type. By
      selecting specific angles and spacing ratios, it can be made
      increasingly orderly, culminating in the most regular form,
      characterized by equal angles and distances, where the fundamental
      shape is a *square*. All these nets contain coherent shapes, and
      it is a general task to determine which modifications can be made
      without disrupting the coherence.  `
  )}
  
  function _149(md){return(
  md`#### The Most General Net
  If one side of the parallelogram in the
      most general net is replaced by an arbitrarily shaped curve while
      keeping its endpoints fixed, then all corresponding sides of the
      other meshes must be replaced by the same curve due to the
      translation. The corresponding sides all lie parallel to the
      replaced side. The straight lines thus transform into waves, whose
      lengths are determined by the length of the replaced side, Fig. 58.  
  This creates shapes that still include two straight opposite sides
      of the mesh, while the other two sides are replaced by the chosen
      free curve. These shapes are also coherent. One can also think of
      them as being generated by intersecting a set of identical and
      parallel waves with a transverse set of straight lines passing
      through corresponding points on the wave lines.  
      The same procedure can be applied to the other pair of sides in the
      parallelogram. Here too, one can draw an entirely arbitrary curve
      between the vertices. If this curve is also multiplied by
      translation in the two principal directions, a mesh is formed in
      which only the corners of the parallelogram---the nodes---remain,
      while all sides are replaced by free curves, Fig. 59. However, not
      all four curves are free; only two adjacent sides are free, while
      the other two are parallel repetitions of the first. This shape is
      also coherent.  
      This represents the most general mesh capable of completely covering
      the entire plane without gaps.  
      One can view this division of the plane as being formed by the
      mutual intersection of two sets of equidistant parallel wave lines,
      where the segments are everywhere equal to the wavelengths.  `
  )}
  
  function _150(md){return(
  md`#### Hexagonal Mesh
  In addition to the quadrilateral with parallel opposite sides, the
      hexagon with parallel and equal opposite sides also possesses the
      property of coherence. Therefore, in such a net, just as with the
      four-sided parallelogram, any pair of equal and parallel opposite
      sides can be replaced with an arbitrary curve between the fixed
      corner points. This produces a new family of coherent forms, which
      until now have been almost entirely unknown. Fig. 60 illustrates a
      pattern derived from such a skewed hexagon.  `
  )}
  
  function _151(md){return(
  md`#### Drawing
  To understand the properties of such forms, one begins
      by drawing a net of parallel lines at any angle and side ratio on
      smooth, thin paper, preferably translucent parchment. Using a strong
      needle and a base of felt or cloth, one punctures the corners or
      nodes. Next, a piece of cloth is glued onto a large, flat cork or a
      suitable piece of wood with a smooth surface and rubbed with a
      mixture of chalk and a little graphite or soot. When the perforated
      sheet is placed over a piece of paper and rubbed with the applicator
      across its surface, the nodes appear as dark points on the paper
      after the sheet is lifted. One can then draw the desired lines
      between the nodes to visualize the resulting forms.  
      Once it has been decided what free stroke will replace one side, it
      is drawn on thick paper and cut out accordingly. Using this guide
      (template), the desired parallel strokes are traced between the
      nodes with a drawing tool.  
      Then, the second stroke, positioned at an angle to the first, is
      determined, a guide is also cut for it, and the corresponding lines
      between the nodes are traced. When all are completed, the coherent
      planar division is evident.  
      Executing such coherent divisions with a selection of typical
      strokes is highly instructive and should not be neglected by anyone
      seeking to delve into the study of spatial harmony.  `
  )}
  
  function _152(md){return(
  md`#### More Orderly Nets
  Among the possible angles, the right angle
      (1/4) stands out as a special case, as it renders all angles equal.
      The parallelogram transforms into a rectangle.  
      Among all side ratios, the ratio of 1, or equality, is the standout
      case. The parallelogram transforms into a rhombus.  
      If both the angles and the sides are equal, the parallelogram
      becomes a square. This is the most orderly division of the plane.  
      Next to the angle 1/4, the angle 1/6 (not 1/5) is the most orderly
      for geometric reasons. A rhombic net with this angle results in a
      grid of equilateral triangles when all the nodes are connected.
      These triangles are not all parallel but alternate in orientation.
      This same grid also enables the complete division of the plane into
      regular hexagons.  
      Additionally, among rectangles, the one with a side ratio of 1:√2 or
      approximately 1:1.414 (around 7:10) holds particular significance.
      This ratio represents the relationship between the side and diagonal
      of a square. Such a rectangle has the property that, when halved, it
      produces a geometrically similar rectangle.  
      From all these nets, perforated tracing sheets are made to transfer
      their nodes onto chosen surfaces. The centimeter serves as the unit
      for measurements. The variety of patterns that can be created with
      these nets is inexhaustible. If 1 cm is too small a unit for the
      mesh, any whole multiple of it can be used, and the corresponding
      node points are located accordingly. The now invalid inner points
      can then serve as helpful guides when drawing.  `
  )}
  
  function _153(md){return(
  md`#### The Golden Ratio
  It is widely believed that the rectangle with
      side proportions governed by the \\"Golden Ratio\\" of 8:13 or 1:1.62
      has a special aesthetic advantage. However, this proves to be a
      misconception. Extensive measurements of common book formats have
      shown a clear average approximation to the ratio 1:√2 or 7:10. When
      a rectangle is created based on the Golden Ratio, most people find
      it too narrow and reject it.  
      This outcome is not unexpected. The Golden Ratio is defined by the
      relationship *a : b = b : (a + b)*, meaning it divides a line so
      that the smaller part relates to the larger as the larger does to
      the whole. This establishes a rule of *linear* division, which
      does not imply that when one part of the line is erected and the
      rectangle completed with two parallel sides, the law is perceived in
      the shape of the *rectangle*; this seems highly unlikely. By
      contrast, the principle of geometric similarity in halving and
      doubling is a proper law for planar shapes and the simplest among
      those conceivable here. Therefore, we regard and use this rectangle
      ratio as the most preferred among all irrational ratios.  
      It should be noted that these considerations apply without
      restriction only to shapes without a special relationship to the
      direction of gravity, such as paper formats, table surfaces,
      carpets, etc. For rectangles standing exclusively upright, such as
      windows or building facades, the fact that the same length is
      perceived differently depending on whether it is horizontal or
      vertical comes into play. This introduces a new psychological law,
      which will not be considered here for the time being.  `

  function _154(md){return(
  md`#### Application
  The described spatial division is extensively used
      for the decoration of surfaces. Since the lines connecting the nodes
      are completely free, they can be derived from natural objects, such
      as plant shapes, to create patterns that fill the surface with
      lawful repetition. The repetition not only serves as an aesthetic
      appeal but is also required by the production process. Whether it
      involves weaving, printing, stenciling, or other techniques,
      repetition greatly facilitates production and, in most cases, makes
      it possible. This is another instance where necessity dictates
      beauty.  `
  )}
  
  function _155(md){return(
  md`#### Alignment
  The creation of such patterns begins with determining
      the type and size of the mesh. Depending on whether the emphasis is
      on highlighting or downplaying orderliness, one chooses the square,
      triangular rhombus, rectangle, or parallelogram. Then, four meshes
      are drawn, and the pattern is initiated, for example, from the
      lower-left corner upwards. Everything drawn there is immediately
      repeated in parallel in the other meshes. The drawing is
      simultaneously extended to the four meshes, ensuring that
      connections to the forms above and to the right are achieved
      seamlessly. This ensures that the forms continue smoothly from one
      mesh to the next, resulting in a surface fully covered with an
      uninterrupted ornamental fabric.  
      An alternative method for the same purpose begins with the main part
      of the pattern roughly in the center of the mesh, which is then
      immediately transferred to the three adjacent meshes. The intended
      connections from one central piece to another are established
      without regard for the mesh boundaries; each line is immediately
      repeated in parallel in the other meshes. Through incremental
      addition and repetition, the entire drawing is completed. It appears
      as a group of four repetitions of the pattern with full alignment,
      providing an accurate representation of the overall effect.  `

  function _156(md){return(
  md`#### Loose Patterns
  If the connection of forms across the entire
      surface is not pursued, the procedure becomes significantly simpler.
      In this case, it is sufficient to ensure good filling of a single
      mesh, and by duplicating it through translation in two directions of
      the net, the overall pattern is created.  
      In such cases, the contrast between *ground* and *pattern*
      becomes particularly pronounced. Clearer results are achieved if
      care is taken to ensure that the ground is clearly identifiable as
      such through consistent connections.  
      Since there is no interest in achieving alignment here, emphasis
      must be placed on ensuring that the content of the pattern
      compensates through the appeal of shapes and colors.  `

  md`#### Rotation and Reflection
  The previous considerations have been
      explicitly limited to cases where the repetition of the form was
      achieved solely through translation. However, alongside translation,
      rotation and reflection provide additional varieties. It should be
      noted that these operations create only finite forms that can be
      enclosed within a circle or a rhombus; only translation leads to
      infinite patterns. Therefore, rotation and reflection are relevant
      only for rendering the *individual form* more lawful; the covering
      of the surface can only be achieved through the translation of these
      resulting forms.  
      This allows us to retain the previously discussed nets, which are a
      clear representation of the possible laws of translation, and to
      examine the applicability of other operations based on the geometric
      properties of the mesh.  `

  function _158(md){return(
  md`#### The Parallelogram Mesh
  In the most general case, where the two
      distances and the angles are different, the mesh becomes a
      parallelogram. Such a shape has no axis of symmetry but does have a
      twofold center of rotation located at the intersection point of the
      two diagonals. This means that when the parallelogram is rotated 1/2
      around this center, it aligns perfectly with its original position
      in terms of sides and vertices, or \\"transforms into itself.\\" This
      is evident from the fact that any line drawn through the center is
      bisected by the boundaries of the parallelogram at equal distances
      on both sides.  
      If a pair of sides of the parallelogram is replaced with any
      arbitrary curve, this property is generally lost. The coherent forms
      thus generated (p. 69) have no center of rotation and therefore lack
      any regularity except for the positioning of the nodes. To retain
      the center of rotation that the parallelogram possesses, the free
      lines between the nodes must adhere to a regularity, which we
      determine as follows.  
      Let *a b c d*, Fig. 61, represent a parallelogram with *m* as its
      center. Divide the side *a b* in half at *f* and draw a free line
      from *a* through *e* to *f*. From each point on this line, draw
      lines through *m* and extend them to the opposite side such that
      their lengths mirror those on the original side. This creates the
      line *d g h*. According to the law of translation, a line must be
      drawn after *c h* that is parallel to *a e f*, and after *f b*, one
      parallel to *h g d*. This establishes the entire line *a e f i b* as
      well as all other sides of the parallelogram parallel to *a b*.  
      Fig. 61.  
      The line *a e f i b* thus proves to be a turnling around *f*, just
      as *c h g d* is a turnling around *h*. This follows from the fact
      that *h g d* results from the rotation of *a e f* around *m* and *f
      i b* arises from the translation of *h g d*.  
      Fig. 62.  
      The same reasoning can be applied to the side *a v* and all its
      parallels.  
      The result is: if instead of completely free lines between the nodes
      of the parallelogram, rotational lines are introduced whose centers
      of rotation lie at the midpoints of the sides, coherent forms are
      created that are twofold turnlings around the mesh centers. Fig. 62
      illustrates an example of this. Due to the increased regularity,
      these forms, which were previously little known, gain an enhanced
      aesthetic value, although it is not easily perceived, as, as
      mentioned, our understanding of turnlings still requires significant
      development.  `

  md`#### Division of Turnlings
  A twofold turnling has the property that
      it can be divided by any line passing through the center of rotation
      into two congruent pieces, which are rotated by 1/2 relative to each
      other. The two halves can take very different shapes depending on
      the position of the line, Fig. 61.  
      Instead of a straight line, any other line with the same effect can
      be drawn, provided it is itself a twofold rotational line. This
      means a line is drawn from an arbitrary point on the edge to the
      center of rotation and repeated by a 1/2-rotation around the center.
      This will cause the line to meet the opposite side of the turnling
      at the corresponding point.  
      Fig. 63.  
      Among all such lines, the most lawful is the simple repetition of
      one of the two side lines. This results in a coherent division of
      the plane into congruent but alternately oriented (rotated by 1/2)
      shapes, which possess a special aesthetic appeal due to this
      interconnection, Fig. 63.  `

  The rectangle has a twofold center of
      rotation in the middle and additionally two axes of symmetry that
      are parallel to the sides and perpendicular to each other, passing
      through the center.  
      To derive the freest or least lawful form from this, one only needs
      to proceed as described on p. 75 for the parallelogram. First, two
      adjacent sides of the rectangle are replaced with arbitrary lines
      connecting the nodes, which are then repeated at all corresponding
      positions in the grid. This creates a spatial division that differs
      from the previously described one only in the right-angled
      arrangement of the nodes, Fig. 64.  
      In this process, neither the center of rotation nor the axes of
      symmetry are utilized.  `

  md`#### Rectangular Turnlings
  To utilize the property of the rectangle
      as a twofold turnling, the two free lines are replaced with two
      rotational lines, resulting in twofold turnlings arranged
      perpendicularly, Fig. 65.  
      Fig. 64.Fig. 65.Fig. 66.Fig. 67.  
      These turnlings can again be divided by a straight line passing
      through the center or by a rotational line into two congruent but
      oppositely oriented shapes. The most lawful of such forms arise by
      using one of the two boundary lines, which are drawn symmetrically
      through the center. Both divisions can also be applied
      simultaneously; the resulting quarters are paired, with each pair
      being congruent but inversely oriented. This establishes a new
      regularity, Fig. 66. The aesthetic appeal of this arrangement
      becomes more pronounced when the interiors of the subdivided areas
      are filled with appropriately aligned decorative elements.  `

  function _162(md){return(
  md`#### Rectangular Mirror Line
  If one attempts to replicate any
      arbitrary line between two adjacent nodes of the rectangular net
      using reflection, it would conflict with the fundamental law of net
      construction, which requires the pure translation of forms. Thus, it
      is not possible to use reflection during the construction of the net
      itself. However, it can be applied in the aforementioned subdivision
      of turnlings.  
      If an internal dividing line is created not through the pure
      translation of one side to the center, but by reflecting it along
      the mirror line passing through the center, this again results in
      two congruent, inversely oriented subforms, Fig. 67. This division
      is more intuitive and therefore more immediately impactful than the
      previous one, corresponding to the general relationship between
      rotation and reflection.

  function _163(md){return(
  md`#### The Rhombus Net
  The rhombus has four parallel sides, a twofold
      center of rotation, and two perpendicular mirror lines, its
      diagonals. From this, the following variations of the rhombus net
      are derived.  
      First, as before, the two pairs of parallel sides can be treated as
      distinct, with each replaced by a free curve. This results in a form
      that, apart from coherence, lacks any additional regularity. Even if
      the four sides are identical and replaced by the same free curve
      (just in different orientations), no additional regularity arises,
      even if the curves are arranged so that pairs of adjacent sides can
      be superimposed through *rotation*, Fig. 68.  
      It is also possible to repeat the curve as a *reflection* of its
      initial orientation along one of the diagonals as a mirror axis. If
      the other two sides are then completed by translating these
      reflected lines, a coherent form is created that is mirror-symmetric
      about one diagonal but not the other, Fig. 69. Due to the preference
      for reflection over rotation, this type of surface division is
      frequently used.  
      If the sides of the rhombus are replaced by the same *rotational
      line* (two different yield no interesting cases), two fundamentally
      different outcomes arise depending on whether the second side is
      derived from the first by rotation or reflection. In the first case,
      a twofold turnling, as previously described, is formed, Fig. 70,
      which appears slightly more lawful due to the side equality. In the
      second case, a doubly mirror-symmetric, rhombus-like shape emerges,
      where both diagonals act as mirror axes, Fig. 71. This results in a
      twofold rose with coherence.  
      A parallel line drawn through the midpoint of one side divides the
      shape, as before, into two congruent, oppositely oriented halves. If
      two parallels are drawn through both sides, the shape is divided
      into four parts, where opposite parts are congruent; all possess a
      mirror axis.  
      The coherent rhombus rose is widely used and forms the basis for
      numerous common patterns.  `
  )}
  
  function _164(md){return(
  md`#### The Square Net
  In a square, there is a fourfold center of
      rotation and four mirror lines oriented towards the sides and
      diagonals, with each pair of perpendicular lines forming a set. The
      first ensures that any introduced line is repeated four times, and
      the mirror lines result in eight repetitions. The four rotational
      positions coincide with every second mirrored position, so no more
      than eight repetitions occur, even if both orders are applied.  
      All derived forms previously described can also be generated within
      the square grid, as this grid contains all the rules that partially
      occur in the other grids. Therefore, it is unnecessary to describe
      these again; focus will instead be given to new forms, which are
      more lawful than the earlier ones.  
      If one replaces a side of the square with an arbitrary line, rotates
      it around one of its endpoints until it replaces the opposite side,
      and completes the square with the corresponding parallels, a shape
      is formed that retains none of the square\\'s rules except for its
      four corner points. Its application is therefore distant.  
      If a side of the square is replaced by an arbitrary line and the
      other by its mirror image along the intervening diagonal, then,
      after completing the other two sides symmetrically, a shape emerges
      that is symmetrical about that diagonal. It essentially has the same
      properties as a figure derived from a rhombus, Fig. 72.  
      If one side of the square is replaced by a rotational line and the
      second by its rotation around one endpoint, the completion of the
      figure results in a *fourfold turnling*, Fig. 73. The turnlings
      obtained so far were all twofold. If two arbitrary rotational lines
      (or straight lines) perpendicular to each other are drawn through
      the center, the turnling is divided into four congruent pieces
      rotated by 1/4 relative to each other. The lawful case is again
      where the two lines are symmetric to the sides, Fig. 74. More
      visually striking is the second case, where both lines are drawn as
      mirror images of the sides, Fig. 75.  
      The subdivision becomes more interesting if the same rotational line
      used to form the sides is employed for cutting but is reflected
      around the diagonals through the midpoints of the sides to pass
      through the center. This results in four congruent subforms, each
      rotated by 1/4 around a side midpoint, Fig. 76. A particularly
      compelling pattern, frequently used by the Moors, arises when two
      arbitrary lines forming a right angle are employed. Fig. 77, again
      depicted as an infinite plane-filling arrangement, provides an
      example. One perceives the presence of significant regularity
      immediately but struggles to fully grasp the law itself. This
      challenge forms the unique appeal of this spatial division.  
      Fig. 76.Fig. 77.Fig. 78.Fig. 79.Fig. 80.  
      Finally, if one side of the square is replaced by a rotational line
      and the other by its mirror image in the diagonal, then completed
      with pure translation, all sides appear as mirror images of their
      neighbors. The shape thus has two perpendicular mirror lines, the
      diagonals of the mesh, Fig. 78. These are not equivalent, so the
      shape is not a fourfold but a twofold rose. If divided by two
      symmetrical lines through the center, it yields not four identical
      pieces but two opposing pairs.  
      Another regularity arises if, instead of using an arbitrary curve to
      generate the rotational line, a mirrored line is employed. In other
      words, one erects a perpendicular at 1/4 of the side length, draws
      an arbitrary line from the side\\'s endpoint to a point on the
      perpendicular, reflects it, and rotates this mirrored line around
      its endpoint at the middle of the square\\'s side. This creates a
      bilateral wave, Fig. 79.  
      This line can be applied to the square grid in two ways. Either the
      second side is derived from the first by rotation or reflection. In
      the first case, a fourfold turnling is formed, Fig. 80, which can be
      divided by two mirror images of the sides into four congruent
      pieces, transitioning into each other through 1/4 rotation around
      the side midpoints. These pieces have two perpendicular mirror
      lines. If divided by two symmetric lines to the sides, four
      congruent pieces also arise, each rotated by 1/4, but with only one
      mirror line, Fig. 81.  
      Fig. 81.Fig. 82.Fig. 83.  
      If the second side is derived from the first by reflection, a
      twofold rose is formed with its mirror lines in the diagonals. This
      can be divided by two symmetric lines to the sides into four
      congruent pieces, corresponding to the previously described turnling
      if the same line is used, Fig. 82. If divided by two mirror images
      of the sides, not four identical forms but two pairs of different
      forms emerge, both being fourfold roses, Fig. 83.

  function _165(md){return(
  md`#### The Triangular Grid
  It was previously noted that the nodes of
      the rhombus grid with an angle of 1/6 also serve as the nodes of a
      grid composed entirely of equilateral triangles. When two sets of
      equidistant parallels intersect at an angle of 1/6, a third set can
      be superimposed such that it also intersects the first two sets at
      1/6 and passes through their intersection points or nodes. This
      forms a grid comparable to the square grid in that it has a regular
      polygon, the simplest one, as its mesh. However, it differs
      significantly from the square grid because not all triangles are
      parallel; only half are, with the rest being mirror images.  
      Each triangle has three axes of symmetry bisecting its angles.
      Additionally, the triangle is a threefold turnling. Furthermore,
      each node in the grid is surrounded by six triangles with one vertex
      at the node, making each node a sixfold center of rotation. Thus,
      the triangular grid simultaneously forms a hexagonal grid. This is
      significant as, apart from the square and equilateral triangle, the
      regular hexagon is the only coherent polygon that exists.  
      By combining two or three sixth-turns, a sixfold center of rotation
      can also be employed as a three- or twofold center of rotation. This
      results in a wide variety of possible forms that can be developed
      within this grid.  
      If one attempts to modify the triangle as was done with other meshes
      by connecting nodes with free curves, it becomes evident that this
      is not generally possible here. The replication of the created forms
      previously relied on translation. Translation is excluded here
      because the triangles in the grid are not parallel but rotated by
      1/6. The same conclusion can be reached through the following
      consideration: Whenever a side of the mesh is replaced by a free
      curve, the mesh's area changes. For four-sided grids, this change is
      equal but opposite on the parallel side, canceling out. With
      triangles, the number of sides is odd, making such cancellation
      impossible.  
      Thus, the same method described earlier (p. 75) must be employed
      here: the compensation must be incorporated into the free curve
      itself so that whatever is added or subtracted in the first half of
      the triangle's area is subtracted or added in the second half. This
      is generally achieved using a rotational line.  
      Fig. 84.  
      The same line is transferred to the other sides by rotation,
      resulting in a freer configuration of the triangles without losing
      their coherence.  
      The overall form becomes a threefold turnling, Fig. 84, with all
      triangles in the grid rotating in the same direction. Thus, every
      such planar division has a mirror image with the opposite rotation.
      These pairs can be used for symmetrically arranged surfaces that are
      to be similarly adorned with infinite patterns.  
      Each threefold turnling is divided into three congruent pieces by a
      threefold rotational star, i.e., a group of three lines created by
      rotating an arbitrary line by 1/3.  `

  function _166(md){return(
  md`#### The Hexagonal Net
  Apart from the equilateral triangle and the
      square, the regular hexagon is the only regular polygon that can
      coherently fill the plane. However, its sides do not form a net with
      continuous lines as in the other two cases, so the concept of
      general forms arising from the intersection of two or three wave
      patterns does not apply here.  
      Fig. 85.  
      Fig. 86.  
      Since the opposite sides are parallel, and their number is even, it
      is again possible to replace them with an arbitrary line alternately
      placed outward and inward. Due to the meeting of three lines at each
      node, the free lines must be arranged to transition into each other
      through rotation. The same order is achieved if the successive sides
      of a hexagon are replaced by a free curve using rotation. This
      results in threefold turnlings in parallel alignment. These can, as
      noted on p. 87, be divided into three congruent pieces by any
      threefold rotational star. If the star is formed from the same free
      curve, considering the rotational relationship, the pieces
      themselves are revealed as twofold turnlings, Fig. 85.  
      If one forgoes complete freedom of the curve and selects it as a
      rotational line, it can be introduced in the same orientation at all
      six sides, resulting in coherent sixfold turnlings, Fig. 86, which,
      to my knowledge, have not been previously used. These can be divided
      into six congruent pieces by any sixfold rotational star. If the
      same rotational line is used to connect the corners, the same
      threefold turnlings arise as in the triangular net (p. 87).  `

  md`#### Geometric Patterns
  The previous considerations focused on the
      boundaries of coherent fields and the variety associated with them.
      In practice, one rarely confines oneself to these forms alone but
      fills them in various ways. One of the simplest fillings, which
      therefore also assumes the simplest boundaries, consists of line
      structures determined solely by the lawful relationships of the
      chosen nets. These represent a pure art of form, entirely free from
      naturalistic influences, and in this respect resemble the tools of
      musical composition.  
      The Arabs, especially the Spanish Moors, who were prohibited from
      using natural forms for religious reasons, brought this art to a
      high degree of perfection. It is not known to what extent they
      arrived at theoretical generalizations. Their practical results
      cover a fairly large range of existing possibilities but by no means
      all.  
      The simplest and most lawful method for creating such patterns is as
      follows: A lawful net is chosen, preferably squares or triangles,
      and within it simple coherent forms, ideally squares or triangles
      again, composed of *4, 9, 16, 25*, or generally *n²* cells. Within
      such a form, a line is drawn, preferably a straight one, between two
      specific points, ideally nodes. This line is lawfully repeated as
      many times as there are reflections or rotations in the mesh.  
      In the square, reflection across its four axes of symmetry generates
      8 lines from a single one, arranged lawfully; in the triangle, 6; in
      the hexagon, 12. Rotation produces 3, 4, or 6 lines. When these
      filled regular triangles, squares, or hexagons are lawfully
      combined, line patterns emerge that intersect regularly and often
      produce highly captivating designs. These are the "geometric
      patterns" in the narrower sense.  `

  md`#### Varieties
  In the preceding explanations, the phrase "the
      simplest" has been frequently repeated. Each time, it signifies
      that in addition to the possibilities presented, there are other,
      less simple ones whose implementation results in new forms. These
      varieties multiply from level to level, resulting in a total that,
      while extraordinarily large, is nevertheless orderly and
      comprehensible. Future research will need to elaborate on these
      possibilities step by step, making the entire field accessible and
      fruitful. At each stage, it will be necessary to arbitrarily halt
      progress, partly to maintain clarity and partly because
      comprehension of more complex cases is not yet developed. This
      understanding must first be acquired gradually through familiarity
      with simpler cases.  
      The possibilities mentioned above include:
  
  <!-- -->
  
  1.  Choice of net;
  
  2.  Choice of coherent form composed of meshes;
  
  3.  Choice of line, which may be straight or curved and whose
      endpoints may lie on or outside the nodes;
  
  4.  Choice of the number of lines;
  
  5.  Choice of the repetition rule (reflection or rotation).
    
  Regarding point 5, it should be noted that the general presentation
      assumes that all reflections and rotations inherent to the mesh of
      the chosen net are utilized. This is not mandatory; specific groups
      can be excluded. For example, in the square net, one can apply only
      the four rotations, resulting in four rather than eight lines from a
      single one. Similarly, one can exclude rotations and use only two of
      the four axes of reflection, creating four lines again but in
      different locations. The same approach can be applied to other
      nets.  
      While this simplifies the result, the possibility described under
      point 4 multiplies it. The introduction of more than one line as the
      \\"theme\\" for processing results in several first-order patterns
      (each created from a single line) being superimposed, so their lines
      intersect lawfully, creating a second- or higher-order pattern. This
      method evidently leads to extremely diverse results. It is often
      applied, particularly with simpler first-order patterns, and
      primarily serves to eliminate deviations from the law of equal
      density, which are not uncommon in simple patterns. The second
      pattern is chosen to fill precisely the gaps of the first.  
      These descriptions have been intentionally limited to the most
      general foundations. A somewhat more complete treatment would
      constitute an extensive science, for which there is insufficient
      space here. It should also be noted that this part of the work,
      which addresses infinite surfaces, does not explore the new
      challenges and solutions arising from the application of these forms
      to finite surfaces. These will be briefly addressed below.  `

  md`#### Example
  To illustrate the remarkable variety and beauty of such
      geometric patterns, Figs. 87 to 102 depict forms derived from
      the square net within a square of 32 = 9 sub-squares by drawing
      straight connections between pairs of nodes. The number of nodes
      here is 16, which coincidentally matches the number of distinct
      connection lines between them and, therefore, also the number of
      first-order patterns. Each 32 square is repeated four times adjacent
      to one another to demonstrate the resulting connections between
      individual patterns.  
      In patterns 87 to 96, the "theme," i.e., the line undergoing
      lawful repetition (in this case, the fourfold reflection of the
      square), is either parallel to one side of the square or lies on an
      axis of reflection, resulting in only four repetitions. These form
      the simpler, generally familiar shapes. The other patterns are
      developed from lines in different positions, producing eight
      repetitions. The resulting forms are largely unfamiliar.  
      Each of the 16 forms can be combined with any other to create a
      second-order pattern, resulting in 120 new forms. These can be
      easily drawn by first placing one pattern in the square net and then
      superimposing the other.  
      Figs. 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100,
      101, 102.  
      By superimposing three patterns, third-order patterns are created,
      totaling 560. A methodological collection of all (simpler) geometric
      patterns is planned, providing an easy overview of second- and
      higher-order patterns.  `

  function _170(md){return(
  md`#### Curved Lines
  Another extensive group of geometric patterns
      arises when the restriction to straight-line connections between
      nodes is abandoned, and curved lines are introduced. These may
      include arcs of circles as a primary option, and secondarily
      segments of catenaries, parabolas, ellipses, or hyperbolas.
      Sinusoidal lines can also be used, often producing novel patterns.
      Fig. 103 shows a pattern derived from a triangular net, from
      which the novel forms Figs. 104, 105, and 106 arise through the
      simplest curved lines.  
      Fig. 103.  
      Fig. 104.  
      Fig. 105.  
      Fig. 106.  
      Each such line can be mirrored symmetrically. By drawing the curved
      line in question and the straight line connecting the two nodes, the
      latter can be considered as the mirror axis, which generates a
      mirrored repetition of the curved line on the opposite side. This
      doubles the number of lines compared to the corresponding
      straight-line pattern. For this reason, at least initially, one will
      primarily treat the simplest patterns in this manner.  
      Patterns frequently form connections with neighboring repetitions,
      leading to continuous meshes if the curves are chosen appropriately.
      Such opportunities for greater regularity should be carefully
      utilized.  
      Instead of treating the connecting straight line between nodes as
      the mirror axis for the curve (which is the technically most
      convenient method for handling patterns), this can be avoided. In
      such cases, a rule must be established for arranging the curve on
      one side of the connecting line while observing the general rules of
      the net. This makes the development of lawful forms somewhat more
      challenging but rewards the effort with the emergence of new and
      captivating patterns. In this case, the patterns formed with curves
      have the same number of lines as those formed with straight lines.  
      Finally, the curve can be multiplied through *rotation* instead of
      mirroring, resulting in an abundance of novel patterns, offering a
      wealth of distinctive and unused forms.  `
  )}
  
  function _171(md){return(
  md`#### Distortions
  All patterns based on lawfully arranged nodes allow
      for an extraordinarily diverse range of transformations through the
      process of lawful *distortion*. For simplicity, let us consider
      purely geometric patterns created by lawful straight-line
      connections of nodes. These lines remain straight if the net is
      stretched or compressed in any way, as long as the nodes maintain
      their linear alignment.  
      For instance, any square net can be transformed into an arbitrary
      skewed net without the geometric patterns within it losing their
      lawful appearance; in fact, they may even gain significant aesthetic
      appeal.  
      If the condition that the mesh lines remain straight is not upheld,
      the straight lines of the pattern will transform into curves. Even
      in such cases, the lawful appearance is preserved, and the
      unexpected combination of lawfulness and freedom that emerges can
      produce significant aesthetic effects. The condition is, again, that
      the resulting freedom appears visually justified.  
      This method of distortion is particularly useful when a lawful
      pattern must be applied to a more freely bounded and shaped surface.
      Simple stretching or compression is used, for example, when a given
      surface needs to accommodate a full number of repetitions, but the
      dimensions of the pattern and the surface do not initially align.  `
  )}
  
  function _172(md){return(
  md`#### Non-Flat Surfaces
  The laws developed for flat surfaces can be
      applied to other curved surfaces with minor modifications. The first
      task is to construct a grid on the curved surface that corresponds
      to the one used on the flat plane. This is straightforward in the
      case of a developable surface, such as a cylinder, but for surfaces
      with double curvature, specific assumptions regarding the
      distortions involved are necessary. These assumptions must be
      regulated by laws derived from the conditions of the case to avoid
      arbitrariness.  
      The most striking feature is that the surfaces of bodies curve back
      on themselves; therefore, the patterns must also exhibit this
      looping characteristic. This is easily achieved by stretching or
      compressing repetitive forms but leads to peculiar results in
      naturalistic representations. Consequently, such representations are
      typically restricted to enclosed frames that cover only a portion of
      the entire surface and are therefore only slightly curved.  `

  function _173(md){return(
  md`#### The Two Sources of Art
  The desire to use free and most free
      linear and planar forms pictorially originates from the activity of
      the second source of aesthetic experience, which flows alongside the
      one based on lawfulness or formal beauty. This second source arises
      from the joy of *imitating natural objects*. It has already been
      noted that in the very primitive artistic expressions of ancient or
      culturally lagging peoples, both elements can be distinctly
      recognized side by side.  
      According to a definition I proposed 20 years ago, and which I have
      found no reason to alter substantively since–although its
      intentionally peculiar form has provided ample cause for both
      deliberate misinterpretation and unintentional
      misunderstanding–art is to be defined as *the craft of
      artificially producing agreeable emotions*.  
      Such emotions arise, on the one hand, through rule-based repetition,
      which is the source of rhythm, that most universal artistic device.
      Secondly, they arise through the generation of vivid
      *recollections* of directly experienced pleasures. These are
      evoked through the visual imitation of objects or events to which a
      particular interest is attached, whereby even dangers, struggles,
      and other significant experiences that accompanied those pleasures
      are soon transfigured into pleasant memories.  
      This is the other source of art. It operates particularly strongly
      in the visual arts, whose naturalistic component still far outweighs
      the formal one to this day. However, it can be assumed that, through
      the discovery of the harmony laws valid for color and form, the
      already frequently prepared and attempted turn toward formal light
      art will occur. This will be comparable to music, including the
      integration of the major artistic device of *temporal*
      variation.  `
  )}
  
  function _174(md){return(
  md`#### Freer Forms
  If one wishes to move from strictly lawful
      repetitions of form to freer design, the justification for this
      greater freedom must first be examined. This justification is found
      in the nature of all natural objects. Every animal and plant belongs
      to a species within which similar individual beings emerge, but
      their forms are never entirely identical. For instance, one can
      immediately distinguish a birch leaf from an oak leaf, even though
      no two birch or oak leaves have ever been entirely identical.
      However, the shape of the leaf, its color, its thickness, and the
      structure of its edge are so characteristic for each individual
      birch or oak leaf that their similarity is readily acknowledged
      despite their differences.  
      This experience is directly utilized aesthetically. When we use real
      natural objects for decorative purposes, in wreaths, bouquets, or
      garlands, we can only approximate lawful recurring forms because
      these differences resist complete uniformity. Such variations also
      enliven and enhance artificial reproductions of such objects. Exact
      repetition suggests artificial manufacturing, which is generally
      perceived as undesirable. In contrast, introducing variations in the
      regularly arranged artificial flowers that correspond to the
      differences found in natural ones pleasantly reminds us of nature,
      enhancing the charm of the work.  
      From this, the rule emerges that form can be treated more freely the
      closer it approaches that of a natural object, the more
      "naturalistic" its depiction becomes.  `
  )}
  
  function _175(md){return(
  md`#### Preservation of Lawfulness
  It is essential, however, that
      despite all freedom, the underlying lawfulness is strictly observed.
      For example, when decorating a structure with wreaths and garlands
      of natural flowers and leaves, the nails used for fastening them
      will be hammered in at precisely equal or lawful intervals, ensuring
      that the order underlying the freedom is clearly perceived.
      Arbitrary differences in spacing would appear disorderly and
      therefore unappealing.  
      The same principle must be maintained when natural forms are used
      decoratively. For instance, if a surface is to be adorned with
      scattered flowers, it is divided using a regular net, the type of
      which should match the nature of the given surface. Care is then
      taken that each field contains one, and only one, flower, with its
      center aligned with the center of the field, regardless of how
      freely it might otherwise be placed. If the traces of the division
      are concealed, the presence of the "hidden law," that far-reaching
      tool of aesthetic design, often amplifies the effect.  
      Conversely, the lack of structure in entirely arbitrary forms, which
      are not based on natural or technical objects, generally appears
      unappealing. In isolated artistic epochs, such as the Rococo,
      arbitrary forms emerged. As long as a hidden law is still effective
      within them, they may be accepted and, under certain circumstances,
      even recognized as delightful. However, if such a law is absent,
      they will be either immediately or eventually rejected because they
      violate the fundamental principle of form harmony, which requires
      lawfulness of some kind.  `
  )}
  
  function _176(md){return(
  md`#### The Law of Equivalent Substitution
  As shown above, the rigidity
      of strictly lawful forms can be gradually loosened by replacing
      prescribed components with others that are not identical but still
      similar. The essence of similarity lies in substituting a component
      of *equal value* (in an aesthetic sense) so that the original
      balance is not disturbed.  
      However, equivalence can be interpreted in increasingly broader
      ways. A larger, minimally subdivided area can be made equivalent to
      a smaller, extensively subdivided one; likewise, a large
      monochromatic area can be made equivalent to a small multicolored
      one. There must always be something present as a substitute for what
      is missing that is approximately as visually striking. In this, the
      creative artist has unlimited possibilities.  
      Such substitutions gain special charm and value when, in addition to
      fulfilling the requirement of equivalence, they also meet another
      demand within the composition, thereby being doubly or even multiply
      motivated. In this way, an entire work can be interwoven with a net
      of diverse relationships. These relationships need not be
      immediately apparent to the viewer; the sense that a hidden law has
      been fulfilled occurs far more frequently than the intellectual
      ability to consciously recognize this feeling. However, for the
      aesthetic effect, the feeling alone suffices.  `

  ## Bounded Surfaces`
  )}
  
  function _178(md){return(
  md`#### General Principles
  Every surface intended for decoration must
      necessarily be bounded. When designing the decoration, its
      boundaries are disregarded if they are complex, variable, hidden, or
      otherwise inconspicuous. In such cases, the infinite surface
      patterns described in the previous section are used, provided that
      prominent directions–such as vertical lines in wall coverings,
      axes of symmetry in furniture, or edge lines in flooring–align
      with the primary lines of the pattern.  
      However, in many cases, precisely defined and visually clear
      surfaces are encountered, where the outer form significantly
      influences the decoration. Such forms are typically symmetrical.
      Circles, squares, rectangles, and ellipses are the main examples;
      hexagons and octagons occur less frequently. Additionally, less
      systematic forms with only one axis of symmetry, such as shield
      shapes, which were more prominent in the past than today, must also
      be considered. The general question arises: How does one decorate
      bounded surfaces?  `
  )}
  
  function _179(md){return(
  md`#### Application of Infinite Patterns
  The first consideration for
      using infinite patterns has already been stated: The primary lines
      of the overall form and the pattern must be lawfully aligned. The
      simplest solution is directional alignment between the two. However,
      under certain circumstances, new effects can be achieved by aligning
      a less prominent direction of the pattern with the primary axis of
      the surface, particularly when such asymmetry is justified by other
      relationships.  
      In such cases, the boundaries of the pattern need no special
      attention, except that the clearly visible symmetry of the main form
      must not be disrupted by asymmetric boundaries of the pattern on
      either side.  
      Moreover, it is essential to ensure a proper ratio between the size
      of the surface and that of the pattern unit. The unit should repeat
      at least five times in the shortest dimension to create the
      perception of indefinite multiplicity. This limits the size of the
      pattern upward. The lower limit is much less precise and mainly
      determined by the typical viewing distance for the surface. At this
      distance, the smallest element of the pattern intended to be
      individually perceived should not be less than 1/1000 of the
      distance (cf. p. 9), although it may be considerably larger
      depending on the purpose.  
      An infinite pattern is often combined with the specific treatment of
      a bounded surface, described later, by serving as a *background*
      for the corresponding decorative elements. In this case, the pattern
      size is best kept close to the lower limit to avoid interference
      with the effect of the superimposed decorative forms (cf. below).  `
  )}
  
  function _180(md){return(
  md`#### Processing the Surface The Central Piece
  The given shape
      should first be examined to determine whether it has a central point
      or multiple main points. For example, when decorating a ceiling, the
      points where chandeliers are to be installed should be considered
      main points. Depending on whether such main points exist or not, the
      design plan will differ. In the first case, forms with a pronounced
      center should be used for decoration; in the latter case, they
      should generally be avoided.  
      Rotational forms and roses have central points; the former have a
      rotational direction, while the latter do not. This distinction can
      guide the choice.  
      Central points are also present in rectangles and rhombuses.
      Squares, hexagons, and other fully or partially regular polygons
      fall under the category of roses and therefore do not require
      separate consideration. In general, a central point is present if
      two or more axes of symmetry intersect or if rotation is present.  
      Ellipses have a center and additionally two focal points. It is not
      known to me whether these have ever been utilized for decorative
      purposes. Experiments I have conducted have yielded good results.  
      Thus, the form and boundary of the central piece should be chosen
      with regard to existing central points and symmetry axes. The size
      can range from nothing to filling the entire area. Typically, it
      occupies about 1/2 to 1/4 of the total surface area.  `
  )}
  
  function _181(md){return(
  md`#### Borders and Spandrels
  The *border* constitutes a second
      prominent area. It is typically decorated with lines, braids, or
      bands of uniform width that encircle the entire form.  
      The width of the border can range from the practical limit of
      visibility (1/1000) to being so wide that it merges with the central
      field. Depending on its shape, in the latter case, the entire
      surface may be filled, or residual areas between the border and the
      central piece may remain, which we shall call *spandrels*.
      Spandrels are generally separate but can also merge if the border
      and central field do not touch. They represent the third prominent
      area.  
      If a base pattern is present and intended to be highlighted, the
      spandrels are a preferred area. In such cases, they remain
      undecorated or are only subtly indicated. Otherwise, the spandrels
      can be decorated along with the border and center.  `

  function _182(md){return(
  md`#### Central Piece, Border, and Spandrel  
  The central piece, border, and spandrel are thus the primary
      components into which the bounded form is divided. It is by no means
      necessary for all three to be equally developed. The border can grow
      broader and richer, starting from a simple boundary line, to the
      point where it extends to the center and displaces the other two
      components. Similarly, the central piece may extend to the boundary,
      impeding the development of the other two components. Furthermore,
      the central piece and border may join in such a way that no space is
      left for the spandrel. Finally, the central piece and spandrel can
      fill the entire surface. Only the spandrel, defined as the residual
      form between the central piece and the border, is excluded from such
      exclusive development.  `
  )}
  
  function _183(md){return(
  md`#### Background and Superimposed Ornament
  Another essential
      conceptual distinction has already been noted, namely, the
      difference between background and ornament. The surface can be
      treated as if it were composed of a specific material, such as a
      fabric, on which the ornamental shapes of the border, central piece,
      and spandrel are placed so that a substantial portion—usually the
      greater part—of the surface remains visible as the underlying
      background. This background may either be uniformly colored or
      covered with an infinite surface pattern, whose alignment with the
      entire surface has just been described.  
      Alternatively, one may forgo a unified background and treat the
      various surface components separately. This approach transitions
      into the complete division of the surface, which we will address
      shortly.  
      Whether the choice of the net used to develop the background pattern
      should make a particular reference to the primary shape is
      debatable. For example, if a rectangular primary shape is divided
      using a rectangular net with the same aspect ratio, the result is
      certainly a highly lawful solution. However, it appears more as a
      design directly derived from the primary shape than as a general
      background. Thus, it may be better to consider such solutions under
      the next perspective of dividing and decorating given forms.  `
  )}
  
  function _184(md){return(
  md`#### Division of the Surface
  Up to now, it has been assumed that the
      given surface is to be treated as a whole. In many cases, especially
      when one direction predominates strongly, it is better to first
      divide the surface and then apply the previously described
      separation into border, central section, and corners to each part.
      The entire surface usually receives a unified frame, which is also
      carried along the dividing lines within the surface to express the
      fact of division. The resulting subdivisions can then be provided
      with an internal border if they are to be more distinctly separated
      from their surroundings.  
      In addition to the shape and use of the surface, division can also
      be prompted by the content of the ornamentation. If the content is
      divided into several distinct and diverse parts, the perception of
      these parts as somewhat independent is secured by the application of
      clear divisions.  
      Careful attention must be paid to the lawful relationships of the
      surface during division to ensure the division is carried out with
      consistent regularity. If the surface has a center point, this must
      be emphasized; similarly, it must be considered whether the surface
      is to be perceived as unilateral or bilateral. For example, when
      dividing the ceiling surface of a long gallery with side windows,
      the window spacings will form the basis for the division; the center
      may need to be more prominently emphasized, and it must be
      considered whether the asymmetry caused by the windows and the
      opposing wall should be explicitly expressed.  
      The resulting subdivisions of the surface are further treated as
      described above, i.e., they are divided into central section, border
      or frame, and corners. The primary lines of the ornamental forms
      must be harmonized with the primary lines of the subdivisions and
      the entire surface.  
      Ornamental forms for the subdivisions may consist of precise or
      mirrored repetitions or free variations of the chosen form. To
      maintain cohesion between the center, border, and corners, the same
      motif may be used in different applications for designing the
      subdivisions. This approach is reminiscent of the contrapuntal
      treatment of themes in music, which has been developed to such high
      refinement.  `
  )}
  
  function _185(md){return(
  md`#### Influence of Gravity
  It must also be considered that a geometrically existing axis of
      symmetry may lose this property for other reasons. For instance, a
      rectangle lying flat has two intersecting axes of symmetry that run
      parallel to the sides through the center. However, when the
      rectangle stands upright, the asymmetry of gravity immediately comes
      into play, making the *top* and *bottom* unmistakably distinct.
      In such cases, the horizontal geometrical axis of symmetry loses its
      significance, and the field is designed differently at the top and
      bottom. Additionally, one can indicate whether the ornament is to be
      perceived as resting or hanging. The importance of the vertical axis
      of symmetry, which aligns with the direction of gravity, becomes
      even greater.  `
  )}
  
  function _186(md){return(
  md`#### The Golden Ratio
  This case provides an opportunity where the
      much-cited Golden Ratio can be appropriately applied. Since the
      vertical axis of symmetry, due to its asymmetry, requires an unequal
      division, the question arises as to the simplest lawful division
      possible. The answer is division according to the Golden Ratio,
      which is adequately represented by the ratio 5:3. Thus, the total
      height is divided into eight parts, of which five are used for the
      main section. This section is at the bottom for a resting structure
      and at the top for a hanging structure.  
      The application of the Golden Ratio here is based on the context of
      a *lawful unequal division of a straight line*. It is only
      suitable where this prerequisite applies.  `

  md`#### Free Surface Arrangement
  If one avoids emphasizing boundaries
      through lines or bands and blends the decorative forms of different
      parts of the surface into one another, the result is the archetype
      of a surface treatment that appears unbounded or free, while
      nonetheless adhering to a concealed, i.e., not immediately
      discernible, law.  
      The particular development of pictorial art has led to the extensive
      application of such surface division in paintings and similar works.
      However, the history of ornamentation also reveals the following
      fundamental traits, which independently recur across various peoples
      and cultures. Initially, the elementary delight in color and
      systematically repeated forms leads to the emergence of pure
      ornamentation, which achieves significant success even in societies
      with underdeveloped overall cultures.  
      Subsequently, another independent stream merges into this flow. The
      source of this stream is the imitation of natural forms (p. 99).
      Initially, only objects of particular interest are depicted, such as
      game animals, women, and enemies. These are followed by tools, war
      expeditions, trophies, and the like. This imitation has the property
      of strongly evoking memories of the associated immediate experiences
      and thereby producing pleasurable feelings independently of those
      experiences. Thus, alongside geometric forms, naturalistic ones
      arise.  
      These are the two sources of all art: the immediate joy derived from
      engaging the senses and the reawakening of past pleasures through
      enhanced memory. Superstitious beliefs connected to depictions often
      attach themselves to these two sources.  `

  md`#### The Backwardness of Light Art
  While, for example, music has
      followed a direct path to the goal of highly developed pure art
      through the very early discovery of the laws of harmony---having
      long surpassed the stage of naturalistic imitation and achieving
      great success through the purely psychological means of harmonically
      and rhythmically measured tonal connections---it has not been so
      straightforward or rapid with light art. Neither the laws of form
      harmony nor those of color harmony (both of which are far more
      complex than tonal harmony) have been known until now.  
      This is particularly evident for color harmony; until a few years
      ago, there was no recognition that it is not primarily determined by
      hue, as was previously widely assumed, but rather by the balance of
      white and black content. As a result, genuine color harmonies were
      only rarely achieved and never perfectly realized.  
      For form harmony, the foundations have been known for millennia
      through the understanding of the elementary laws of geometry. Hence,
      even less developed cultures such as the Egyptians, Arabs, Moors,
      Persians, and Chinese have widely cultivated it. However, their
      development into a higher art form was always hindered by the
      inability to harmonize the forms with color harmoniously, due to the
      lack of necessary knowledge.  
      Thus, all these promising, in some cases highly advanced approaches
      to pure light art withered because this vital element was missing.
      In the Orient, where a small portion of empirical color harmony had
      been achieved through the very long tradition involving a few
      specific dyes, light art accordingly achieved a corresponding,
      albeit limited in scope, richly developed ascent. Nevertheless, a
      free development was not achieved there due to the narrowness of the
      mastered color range.  `

  md`#### Painting
  Thus, we see visual art taking a side path that,
      particularly in our time, appears to have become a dead end. It is
      the pursuit of representational interest in the depicted subject,
      the *naturalistic* path. This interest was previously identified
      as one of the two sources of art; for traditional visual art, it
      remained almost the sole source. If one examines ornamentation, for
      instance, in medieval manuscript decoration, it originates from
      lawful planar design, enlivened by the use of the purest and most
      vibrant colors, corresponding to the primitive delight in individual
      color. Since the aesthetic values found in the harmonious
      interaction of colors are either not discovered or only incompletely
      so, we observe interest shifting increasingly toward more precise
      naturalistic representation. Initially flat ornaments are given
      gradations of the same tone for plastic effects; the geometrically
      stylized natural forms are brought progressively closer to their
      real-world templates. Eventually, we find plants and animals
      depicted with naturalistic fidelity, with their plasticity
      emphasized by painted shadows on the background.  
      The same development occurs even more rapidly in images that do not
      primarily serve decorative purposes. Religious art initially appears
      in the strictest forms. It undergoes the same naturalistic
      development, accelerated by the much stronger representational
      interest. Through this evolution, a freer subject matter emerges,
      first mythological and then increasingly universal and human in
      character, distinct from the religious context. Portraiture and
      landscape painting develop as distinct branches of art.
      Alternatingly, either the representational or the lawful formal
      aspect comes to the forefront, with each claiming exclusive validity
      in the exaggerated manner of such subconscious tendencies.  
      The one-sided naturalistic development of painting has, in turn,
      significantly hindered the development of harmonic forms. Just as
      with colors, forms are largely determined by the natural objects
      depicted in the painting, leaving no room or opportunity for the
      free development of a rich and varied interplay of forms. Thus, in
      contemporary visual art, harmonic forms, like harmonic colors, are
      confined to the simplest foundations, applied in a very vague and
      approximate manner. Nonetheless, there is currently a strong
      inclination to enhance these values, both subconsciously felt and
      consciously pursued.  `

  function _191(md){return(
  md`#### The Regularity of Free Forms
  Our current, thoroughly
      naturalistic pictorial art is generally unable to fully execute
      simple spatial rhythms in its works, as the subjects depicted do not
      permit this. Where such rhythms are dictated by the subject, such as
      in architectural images, a somewhat more intricate arrangement is
      preferred, achieved through the perspective displacement and
      compression of equidistant segments. This accounts for the
      considerable appeal of precise perspective renderings.  
      Where there is some freedom in arranging forms on a larger scale,
      particularly in figurative paintings, there has always been an
      effort to comply with the primary principle of harmonic form by
      establishing some simple geometric relationship among the elements.
      The old rule of the pyramidal structure of groups is a particular
      instance among many; one can equally base the composition on another
      formal idea (e.g., circle, ellipse, square, parabola, or
      combinations thereof) and achieve similar, often stronger effects.
      This foundational form does not necessarily need to be symmetric
      about the image's central axis. A deliberately conceived and
      emphasized asymmetry can have especially effective results, but it
      must be justified by the content of the image.  
      The ability to convey a specific formal concept appears relatively
      more limited in *landscapes*, as they inherently include certain
      arrangements: sky, distance, middle ground, and foreground. However,
      even here, the format of the image, the height of the horizon, the
      distribution of the grounds, etc., allow for numerous freedoms which
      the artist can use in accordance with the principles of regularity.
      Most "beautiful vistas," i.e., pictorially effective sections of
      nature, derive this quality from the fact that an accidentally
      present formal regularity is so pronounced that it imposes itself on
      any viewer. The artist's ability to find images in nature lies in
      perceiving less obvious regularities. A critical aid in this process
      is isolating the pictorial segment of nature from the indifferent or
      distracting surroundings. A frame of black cardboard, a viewfinder
      like those attached to cameras by photographers, or a mirror with
      its defined boundary are tools that greatly facilitate the
      identification of such a natural excerpt. Even the skilled artist
      who does not need these tools to discover their "motif" will gladly
      use them for the precise delineation of the composition.  
      Within the freedom dictated by the subject depicted, the following
      principles of regularity can be applied in detail.  `
  )}
  
  function _192(md){return(
  md`#### Uniform Density
  The simplest formal regularity applicable here
      is the *uniformity of surface coverage*. There should be no
      "empty" areas in the image. The desire to meet this requirement in
      naturalistic depictions often leads to adding various incidental
      elements to such empty spaces. This explains, among other things,
      the presence of scattered objects, books, clothing, etc., on the
      floor in paintings. Such intentional disorder is thus called
      "picturesque," though in a somewhat different sense.  
      In the decorative arts, the principle of uniform density is
      extensively applied, not only when natural forms are used, which
      inherently resist rigid rhythm. The seemingly arbitrary but lawful
      arrangement of design elements is, for instance, one of the most
      effective tools in the highly developed decorative art of the
      Japanese.  `
  )}
  
  function _193(md){return(
  md`#### The Central Axis
  Another very natural way to organize a surface
      is by emphasizing the central element. The most important part of
      the image is placed at the center, or, given the asymmetry imposed
      by gravity, on the vertical central axis above the geometric center
      of the image. Here, the Golden Ratio finds its appropriate
      application, and it is very likely that this ratio is predominantly
      applied, either consciously or unconsciously.  
      From the elevated point of the central axis, the "composition"
      often spreads symmetrically downward, resulting in the triangular or
      "pyramidal" structure underlying countless pictorial arrangements.
      Over time, there is a trend toward loosening the straight sides in
      favor of more dynamic boundary movements.  `
  )}
  
  function _194(md){return(
  md`#### Composite Balance
  This is where the principle of composite balance (p. 101) comes into
      play. If one side is treated more loosely than the other, it must
      have a larger surface area to balance the denser, more compact side.
      Similarly, strong and weak colors, detailed or generalized drawing,
      and vivid or subdued lighting contrasts can be balanced against one
      another. In the work of highly skilled painters with a good sense of
      spatial relationships, this mutual compensation of various elements
      sometimes takes on a highly intricate form, as ultimately all
      expressive means of the image can contribute to such mutual balance.
      This constitutes "artistic quality" in a higher sense.  `
  )}
  
  function _195(md){return(
  md`#### Other Mirror-Image Forms
  In addition to compositions based on the central element or pyramid,
      there are many others structured around simple geometric shapes,
      arranged in mirror symmetry about the vertical centerline in the
      broader sense of composite balance. Such arrangements are more
      commonly found in portrait-oriented images than in landscape formats
      because the centerline is longer and therefore more significant in
      the former. A vertical line in a landscape format cannot assume this
      level of importance, even if defined by a prominent feature such as
      the horizon, because gravity disrupts the equivalence between top
      and bottom while leaving that of left and right undisturbed.  `
  )}
  
  function _196(md){return(
  md`#### Asymmetrical Weighting
  The harmony of form does not lie solely
      in uniformity or balance but in its lawfulness overall. Thus, any
      other principle of order can also be expressed in the arrangement of
      forms, provided it is a *law*—a clearly conceived and executed
      formal idea.  
      For example, many landscapes depict a shore where the land, with its
      numerous details, occupies one side of the image, while on the
      other, the shore fades into the distance between air and water.
      Here, a reclining wedge-shaped base form organized around the
      horizontal horizon dominates, and its clear articulation gives the
      image its formal appeal. Since gravity operates vertically to the
      horizon, full symmetry about the horizon is not recommended,
      although reflections in the water may sometimes suggest it. The
      artist will rarely fail to emphasize the tangible nature of the
      foreground in contrast to the air above, thereby breaking full
      symmetry. This does not exclude cases where symmetry is used
      intentionally as an artistic device to achieve specific effects.  
      Similarly, in this example, just as one side may dominate, in other
      cases, a corner of the image—such as the upper right, lower left,
      and so on—can serve as the focal point or entryway to the visual
      subject. All of this is effective, provided that the spatial concept
      is well-grounded and executed without uncertainty.  `

  md`#### A Reference to the Future
  The title of this chapter indicates
      that a work on the harmony of form, following the study of
      *points*, *lines*, and *planes*, should include a
      corresponding investigation into the lawful *solid* forms to
      complete the circle of topics, though not to exhaust it.  
      There can be no doubt about the correctness and importance of this
      task. The harmony of solid forms is, among other things, the
      aesthetic foundation of architecture. Moreover, all tools and
      everyday objects, even machines and other technical constructs,
      ultimately require the application of solid-form harmonics if they
      are to achieve perfection.  
      Precisely because of the importance of this task, I do not feel
      capable of undertaking it. Above all, I lack the foundation of
      extensive practice and experience in this area, without which
      successful work is impossible. While the inexhaustible tools of
      mathematics can yield rich results even from relatively limited
      material, the character of this work, which aims to lay the
      groundwork for the field, requires not so much individual
      contributions as the clarification of the most general
      relationships. And this work, if I were even capable of it, would
      require so much preliminary effort that it would consume my energies
      for years. These energies are already committed: the practical
      dissemination of color theory to the broadest strata of German
      society has the first and, at present, unassailable claim upon
      them.  
      Thus, I must content myself with pointing to this open field of work
      and inviting others to take it up. The triplicity of solids compared
      to the duality of planes immediately suggests that the varieties
      appearing here are far more numerous than those that could only be
      outlined, not developed, for planes. A very extensive effort will be
      required to address this task.  
      Theoretical crystallography has already made significant preliminary
      contributions, but it covers only one of many areas, and the study
      of these forms under the aesthetic principles relevant here requires
      a new systematic approach. Many other areas remain barely known, let
      alone explored.  
      All of these are open to free exploration.  `
