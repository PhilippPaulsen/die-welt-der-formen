  md`#### Space
  By *space*, we mean the way in which we experience the external world. If we disregard all specific contents that come to our consciousness in the form of colors, sounds, temperatures, pressure sensations, etc., and instead ask what all parts of the external world have in common, their *spatial nature* remains. Accordingly, every object has its own share of the total space in which we perceive the external world; we call this share its *shape* [Gestalt] or form, whereby such a form or shape may exhibit all degrees of determinacy or indeterminacy.`

  md`#### The Three Types of Space  
  Space is either *corporeal*, *planar*, or finitely *linear*. In the first case, it is *three-dimensional*, in the second *two*-dimensional, and in the last *one*-dimensional. If we wish to consider its manifestations, as is necessary when working on a new domain, in the sense of increasing complexity, we must begin with the simplest case, the linear *space*, and then proceed to examine the two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces.  
  In geometry, the aforementioned determinations are carried out with the utmost rigor. Planes have no thickness, lines no width, and points no extension. The practical-aesthetic spatial theory that concerns us here does not allow for such extensive abstractions. Our lines will always have a distinct width, our planes a certain thickness or height, without letting these considerations disturb us. It is only required that the one-dimensionality in lines and the two-dimensionality in planes predominate so strongly that the existing deviations do not carry weight, i.e., do not significantly alter the phenomena under investigation.`

  function _8(md){return(
  md`#### The Uniformity of Space
  When we move a rigid body through space, we
  generally perceive it as different. However, through a not entirely
  simple process of abstraction, we come to the understanding that these
  differences are merely subjective-perspectival and arise from the
  changed spatial relationship between the body and the observer's eye,
  not from the body itself. Instead, we attribute to it everywhere the
  same shape or spatial nature.  
  If we successively place the body in adjacent positions, *identical*
  spatial parts arise according to this premise. This is the foundation of
  all division and therefore all *measurement* of space. We find that
  this procedure can be carried out consistently throughout space and
  therefore attribute to space uniformity (*homogeneity*). `

  md`#### Geometric and Illustrative Lines and Points
  A geometric line, which
  by definition has no width, is invisible, as visibility requires a width
  of approximately 0.0001 of the visual angle (i.e., 1 mm at a distance of
  10 m). Thus, the figures of finite width, to which our considerations
  apply, are geometrically not lines, but planes, specifically elongated
  rectangles.  
  Similarly, geometric points, the only possible distinctions on a
  geometric line, are invisible and must be replaced by small planes to be
  visible. `

  md`#### The Fundamental Principle of Spatial Harmony
  If a point is represented by an *arbitrarily* shaped small surface, as shown in Fig.
  1, we are dissatisfied. We ask the designer why this particular random
  form was chosen and are only satisfied if an adequate explanation is
  provided. However, if the point is represented by a circular area, a
  square, or a hexagon, as in Fig. 2, we agree and raise no further
  questions. This assumes that the form is not tilted, as in Fig. 3; in
  such a case, we would inquire about a justification for this
  arbitrariness, whereas with an upright position, whether horizontal or
  diagonal, as in Fig. 4, we are satisfied.  
  Similarly, we agree if a line or stripe is evenly spaced, as shown in
  Fig. 5. On the other hand, if the division is arbitrary, executed with
  unequal spacing, as in Fig. 6, we reject it. It lacks the small but
  distinctly present positive aesthetic value of uniform division, instead
  possessing a negative one; it appears unattractive.  
  However, not every unequal division is unattractive. If the spacings of
  the divisions are assigned as, for example, those on the logarithmic
  slide rule for equally spaced numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., Fig. 7, a
  positive aesthetic value arises. These spacings have the property that
  any two successive ones decrease in the same ratio (according to a
  geometric or logarithmic series). Upon closer examination, this series
  even possesses an aesthetic advantage over the evenly spaced one. It
  appears \\"more interesting\\" because it is much less frequently
  encountered than the latter.  
  From these and countless other observations, we derive (in a very broad
  generalization) a law, which states:  
  
  *All lawful forms are harmonious.*  
  
  By harmonious, we mean beautiful or pleasant in the broadest sense. This
  statement, the *Fundamental Principle of Spatial Harmony*, has the
  nature of a postulate, i.e., a probable assumption that serves as a
  primary order of facts and whose validity must always be tested through
  concordance with experience. It is identical to the Fundamental
  Principle of Color Harmony, and it holds a general significance for all
  art. We can also express it in the form of an equation:  
  
  *Lawfulness = Harmony.*  
  
  Goethe conducted his entire artistic life\\'s work in the light of this
  insight and also expressed it explicitly in the closing words of his art
  sonnet:  
  
  *And only law can give us freedom.*  
  
  We therefore call this general law of art, of which color and spatial
  harmony are merely specific applications, the *Goethean Law*.  `

  md`#### Types of Lines
  The simplest structure that exists here is the
  uninterrupted, uniformly strong line, as drawn with the ruling pen,
  pencil, or pen. It can be *straight*, *curved*, or composed of
  several straight, several curved, or both straight and curved lines. The
  straight line is the most important because it is the simplest or most
  lawful case; a completely arbitrary stroke represents the opposite
  extreme of complete freedom.  
  The main application of the line is, according to its origin, the
  delimitation of surfaces. If these are differentiated by color,
  position, etc., the boundary lines arise naturally. However, art tends
  to emphasize such natural phenomena with special forms; for example, two
  different surfaces are usually not simply joined but rather highlighted
  by a special line (in the graphic sense). Additionally, the line serves
  as a tool to *divide* a surface that is not yet differentiated, which
  is a very important task.  `
  )}
  
  function _13(md){return(
  md`#### Thickness of Lines  
  The first requirement that must be met by a line is its *clarity*. It
  was previously noted that the visibility of a line ceases when its width
  falls below 1/10,000 of the viewing distance. In art, such extreme
  values (except for special purposes) are widely avoided; a practical
  lower limit can be set at approximately ten times that value, 1/1,000.
  For an object with a surface width of 50 cm at its narrowest, the line
  should not be narrower than 1/2 mm for our purposes.  `
  )}
  
  function _14(md){return(
  md`#### Edge or Contour
  As a marker of a boundary, the line must follow it.
  In the simplest case, it lies directly on the boundary. However, there
  are numerous cases where it accompanies the boundary at a certain
  distance. *This distance must be equal everywhere*, measured
  perpendicular to the boundary line. It must, in any case, be greater
  than the minimum line width and is usually significantly larger.  
  For example, if a rectangle is provided with such a boundary line, the
  distance is not made different along the sides in proportion to the side
  lengths, Fig. 8, so that the inner rectangle would geometrically
  resemble the outer one. In such a case, the accompanying line would not
  be perceived as an *edge*. Instead, the distance is taken to be equal
  everywhere, Fig. 9, which makes the inner rectangle relatively slimmer
  than the outer one.  `
  )}
  
  function _15(md){return(
  md`#### Diversity
  When going beyond the immediate purpose of marking, one can multiply the simple, uniform line sequence for decorative purposes. This can be done in the following ways:
  
  1.  The line is (entirely or approximately) uniform in thickness and continuous;
  
  2.  the line is discontinuous, being broken into a series of dots and dashes;
  
  3.  the line varies in thickness along its course¹;
  
  4.  the line is not straight but dynamic, i.e., somehow curved or broken.  
      Properties 2, 3, and 4 can simultaneously occur in the same line. 
      Since each of these properties offers two possibilities (present or
      not present), there are a total of eight groups encompassing a very
      large number of individual cases.
        
      ¹ H. Prof. Krais brought this diversity to my attention.  `
  )}
  
  function _16(md){return(
  md`#### Individual Examination  
  We turn to the separate consideration of the cases just outlined. It
  should be noted that it will not later be possible to examine all
  the numerous possibilities arising in the less simple figures
  (braids, bands, surfaces) with the same level of detail; thus, the
  following considerations not only serve to elucidate the current
  task but also as an example of how the reader might later fill in
  the framework provided by the mathematical treatment of the cases.
  It should also be noted that the diversities identified here will
  apply universally to later cases. For we are always dealing either
  directly with lines or with the mutual boundaries of surfaces, which
  are also lines. However, in the latter case, one will approach the
  design of the line in the sense described here with greater restraint.  `
  )}
  
  function _17(md){return(
  md`#### Discontinuous Lines
  The resolution of a simple line can occur
      into *dots* and *dashes*. Accordingly, there are discontinuous
      lines consisting solely of dots, solely of dashes, and finally of
      dots alongside dashes.  
      The dots are either round or square. The second form arises
      naturally when the line is created with a pen through regular
      interruptions of the stroke. Round dots are more natural and appear
      where pen creation is not feasible, for example, in letterpress
      printing. The spacing, simplest when equal to the dot width, can
      also be adjusted arbitrarily, Fig. 10 a.  
      The dashes can vary in length. However, they must not be so short
      that they are confused with dots, nor so long that the interruptions
      appear arbitrary. A length five to ten times the thickness seems
      appropriate. The spacing must maintain a visible proportion to the
      dash length, approximately 1:5, Fig. 10 b.  
      It would be worthwhile to examine these proportions more closely to
      determine where the most pleasing effects occur.  
      When combining dots and dashes, the alternation *p s p s p s ...* or
      abbreviated as *p s* is the simplest case, Fig. 10 c. More complex
      cases, such as *p p s, p p s s, p p p s*, etc., are less common and
      eventually become confusing.  
      For all cases considered, the law holds that the sizes and spacings
      of the segments remain consistent throughout the entire line
      sequence. An unlawful deviation would appear disorderly and
      arbitrary, thus unattractive. However, the simple law of equality is
      not the only possibility. One can also group multiple dots (dashes)
      into clusters that are separated by larger but still equal intervals
      among themselves. This creates a more intricate equality, but still
      maintains lawfulness. `

  function _18(md){return(
  md`#### Unequal Thickness
  The design of the writing pen with two
      springy tips, which open depending on the pressure applied,
      naturally produces this effect, which is of the most general use in
      writing. It is noteworthy that the previously (in English script)
      popular *continuous* transitions from one thickness to another are
      increasingly regarded as less beautiful and are being replaced by
      clear distinctions between thick and thin strokes, resulting in a
      stronger and more \\"characterful\\" script.  
      This type is used less frequently for line decoration; it is most
      often employed where a connection to handwritten work is to be
      emphasized. The diversity is similar to that of the previous case,
      except that the interruptions of the line are replaced by its
      variations in thickness.`

  function _19(md){return(
  md`#### Dynamic Lines
  As book ornaments, lines can be found that show
      small irregularities, as if drawn freehand. They are an expression
      of a skewed sentimentality that ascribes a \\"higher artistic value\\"
      to craftsmanship and seeks to create its semblance even where it is
      evidently excluded by the method of production.  
      Significantly different from these are the *lawful* dynamics. As a
      very general principle, *repetition* emerges, as already discussed
      in the context of interrupted lines. Through lawful repetition, one
      can remove arbitrariness from any free stroke and bestow upon it the
      simple aesthetic value inherent in visual lawfulness.  `
  )}
  
  function _20(md){return(
  md`#### Shifting.
  Repetition occurs along the direction of the entire
      line, as the chosen form is repeated at a fixed, consistent
      interval, effectively "shifted." This process is thus referred to
      as *shifting*.  
      Shifting involves mapping each point in the original form to a
      corresponding point in the second position, equidistant from the
      original. All these connecting lines, of identical length, are also
      *parallel*¹.  
      This results in an exact repetition of the original form at a
      defined distance from it.  
      Shifting is one of the three fundamental operations through which a
      simple form element can give rise to a lawfully composed form. For
      this reason, it will frequently be employed in the discussions that
      follow.  
      Shifting can be repeated indefinitely, producing lines of any
      desired length.`

  md`#### Sequences and Waves.
  The line repeated through shifting is
      initially assumed to be entirely arbitrary. In particular, we do not
      assume that the beginning and end of the repetitions of the original
      form created by shifting coincide. The only regularity present in
      the resulting overall form, which we shall call a *sequence*, is
      limited to the bare repetition. Fig. 11 shows a sequence.  
      *Fig. 11*  
      If the form is such that the beginning aligns with the end during
      repetition, resulting in a single, continuous line as the long form
      develops, the resulting structure is called a *wave*.  
      We initially apply no further rules to the wave other than that the
      line runs continuously, Fig. 12.  
      *Fig. 12*  
      The size of the shift for any form to create waves is called the
      *wavelength*. Since, according to the description of shifting, all
      distances between corresponding points are equal, the same
      wavelength is found regardless of the point from which it is
      measured to the corresponding point of repetition. The *wave* can
      therefore be viewed and drawn from any arbitrary point. Often, the
      original form is such that it contains particularly distinctive
      points, which are well-suited for measurement.  
      Every wave has a specific *wave height*. Through the highest and
      lowest points of the wave, one draws a straight line in the
      direction of the wave; the distance between these lines is the wave
      height. This determines the width of the strip covered by the
      wave.  `
