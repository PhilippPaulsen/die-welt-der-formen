### December 2025 · 5-Day Website Improvement Checklist  
*(Aligned with project goals, README scope, and current site state)*

This checklist prioritizes clarity, structure, and research legibility over feature expansion.  
Primary focus: **consolidating the website as an editorial and research environment**.  
Secondary focus: **making Raumharmonik visible as an emerging, explicitly open research strand**.

---

#### **Day 1 — Orientation & Project Framing**

**Goal:** A first-time visitor understands the project within 30 seconds.

- Clarify the project description on the start page:
  - research project (not a product, not a portfolio)
  - historical + contemporary
  - editorial + generative
- Add or refine a short framing sentence:
  > “This platform is a digital editorial and research environment dedicated to the reconstruction and continuation of Wilhelm Ostwald’s theory of form.”
- Align tone and terminology across all main pages.
- Identify terms that require explanation or contextual framing.

**Outcome:** Trust, clarity, and intellectual positioning.

---

#### **Day 2 — Navigation & Structural Consistency**

**Goal:** Users always know where they are and how pages relate.

- Ensure active navigation states are clearly visible.
- Check DE / EN parity (structure, tone, hierarchy).
- Standardize page titles and headings.
- Add a short “What is this page?” editorial introduction to:
  - Harmony of Forms (edition / reference text)
  - World of Forms (systematic documentation of generative principles)
- Visually separate:
  - introduction
  - main content
  - contextual / forward-looking notes

**Outcome:** Orientation without explanation.

---

#### **Day 3 — Harmony of Forms (Editorial Readability)**

**Goal:** Improve readability without simplifying the content.

- Add a short editorial introduction:
  - historical context
  - editorial status (digital edition / reference)
  - how to read and use the text as a theoretical source
- Improve figure placement and textual references.
- Break up very long text blocks visually.
- Ensure figures clearly relate to nearby passages.

**Outcome:** Sustained reading and scholarly usability.

---

#### **Day 4 — World of Forms (System Visibility)**

**Goal:** Make the underlying rule systems explicit.

- Add a clear introductory explanation:
  - this is a system, not a gallery
  - patterns result from explicit formal rules
  - the presentation is documentary rather than exploratory
- Explicitly explain:
  - theme
  - reflection
  - repetition
- Improve reader guidance:
  - how to look at
  - how to compare
  - how to interpret patterns

**Outcome:** Understanding precedes visual fascination.

---

#### **Day 5 — Raumharmonik & Global Polish**

**Goal:** Integrate Raumharmonik carefully and improve overall coherence.

**Raumharmonik**
- Add a short visible note (Start or About page):
  - Raumharmonik as a continuation explicitly announced by Ostwald
  - framed as an open research horizon rather than a completed section
  - clearly marked as ongoing
  - no separate navigation yet

**Global Polish**
- Review typographic distinctions:
  - historical text
  - editorial commentary
- Remove small inconsistencies in wording and hierarchy.
- Final tone check:
  - precise
  - calm
  - non-didactic

**Outcome:** Conceptual closure and readiness for further development.

---

#### **Optional Extension — Interactive Elements (Only if Useful)**

Interactive elements should **support understanding of formal rules**, not visual distraction.

Replacing static SVG figures with interactive JavaScript visualizations is considered a long-term enhancement and should only be implemented where interaction clarifies structural principles (e.g. symmetry, repetition, transformation) that static images cannot adequately convey.

- Use interactivity only where it explains:
  - repetition
  - symmetry
  - parameter variation
- Keep interactions minimal and legible.
- Avoid gamification.

**Guiding question:**  
*Does this explain something text alone cannot?*

### Guiding Principle

> **Orientation → Structure → System → Interpretation → Interaction**
